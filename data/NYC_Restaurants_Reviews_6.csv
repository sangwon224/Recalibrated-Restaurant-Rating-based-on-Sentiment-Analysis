1,Rosie O'Grady's,"148 W 51st St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.2,Julia NORTHCOTT,"My husband and I are visiting from the UK and have been in twice, once for drinks (they do an amazing 7% cider on tap which is absolutely lovely … we are from Devon, we are cider experts) and once for food this evening! Both had Fillet Mignon … best steak I’ve ever eaten! You could cut with a spoon! And the peppercorn sauce was excellent!

Service excellent, Rory on the bar is brilliant and remembered my husbands name from 2 nights ago! And lovely hearing an Irish accent!

Definitely visit! Cannot rate highly enough",5
2,Rosie O'Grady's,"148 W 51st St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.2,Miguel Guerrero,"While staying at the Hilton Midtown we went out for a dinner and ran across Rosie O'Grady, not far from the hotel. This restaurant just reopened. They have two bars (one was pretty noisy and crowded with people who work around there).  However, the dining room was quiet and well appointed. My daughter and i had as an appetizer the fried calamari.  Yum!  We have had fried calamari in many restaurants, this is the first time I can remember where it wasn't chewy.  A light batter and a delicious dipping sauce made it wonderful. For entrees, my wife had a filet mignon which was cooked to perfection (they butterflied it since my wife likes steak well done......) with grilled asparagus.  My daughter and I had the Jumbo shrimp and scallops risotto.  Delicious.  Good meal and for NYC and the location not overly pricey.  Wait staff was excellent and friendly.  Will definitely go back again when we visit.",5
3,Rosie O'Grady's,"148 W 51st St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.2,Irada Emely,"Had a lovely dinner with my husband on a weekday night. Nice, brand new interior, very decent menu. The location is in the heart of Manhattan, but at a quiet side street. Loved the raw bar sampler. Excellent service! Ask to be seated at Alicia’s station. We had her as a server. She is amazing!",5
4,Rosie O'Grady's,"148 W 51st St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.2,A R,"Update... Just visited Rosie O'Grady's new location that is now in the old Ruth Chris space on 51st Street, a block from the original location. We are so glad to see this establishment make a comeback. The food and service were great today, and the new digs are very classy! We will definitely be returning...

Rosie O'Grady's is one of our all-time favorite New York City pubs. The restaurant is large and the bar area is fantastic. Have visited here dozens of times over the years and never had a bad experience with the food or service, and this includes a couple of private parties attended. Rosie's is a must visit place if you're into good pub food and atmosphere.",5
5,Rosie O'Grady's,"148 W 51st St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.2,Troy Griffin,"My wife and I went to the new Rosie O Grady’s on 51st street. Very different from the old one, much more elegant. I had the rack of lamb and my wife had the spinach steak salad, both were very tasty.

The  best part was our server Alicia!!!

She was so accommodating to my dietary needs, and had a great personality. We will definitely be back.",5
6,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.1,Breighanna Minnema,"My boyfriend and I wanted to have the Olive Garden experience. We are New Yorkers so we have experienced plenty of amazing authentic Italian food. This was fun for sure. It’s a MASSIVE restaurant. We got a nice table by the window. The food was decent, not horrible, what you would expect from Olive Garden. We got soup and breadsticks and pastas. I wouldn’t go again for another 5-10 years but it was fun.",3
7,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.1,Nadav Meir,"Huge restaurant, thr chain's largest restaurant, so it's a bit hard to relate the atmosphere. They do manage to give the feeling of an Italian restaurant, even though the place is very American. The portions are huge and the bread and salads come free. All in all, the food was quite tasty and for the price they charge, we really enjoyed it. Our waiter was also exceptional and gave a very pleasant feeling even though he had many tables .",5
8,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.1,Jordan Booth,"My fiance and I decided to try into the Olive Garden on Monday. It was my first ever visit to this iconic American chain restaurant.

When we arrived, we were warned of a possible wait, but were pleasantly surprised to be seated almost immediately which was great.

Our waitress, Jilly, deserves special recognition for her exceptional service. She effortlessly guided us through the menu and ensured our meal was nothing short of perfection. She always ensured our drinks and breadsticks for top top, which was lovely.

As for the food, the portions were beyond generous! Free breadsticks and soup were delightful extras, though hardly necessary given the size of the main courses. I opted for the Chicken Parmigiana, while my fiance indulged in the Prawn Alfredo, both of which were bursting with flavor and left us wanting more.

Although some may find the food slightly on the salty side, we have found that with most of the food we have eaten here in America and I quite like it. You’re definitely make use of your unlimited refill, soft drinks though as you’ll need to quench your thirst. The value for money was great considering the quality and quantity of food we received.

In summary, our first experience at Olive Garden was an absolute delight, thanks to the warm atmosphere, impeccable service, and mouthwatering dishes. It's safe to say we'll be returning for another taste on our next visit to the United States.",5
9,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.1,Philip Van Mechelen,"Verry fun experience if you're not from the USA.

The food is good and portion are huge.
We waited 20 minutes before we got a table (party of 4)",4
10,Olive Garden Italian Restaurant,"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.1,Clinton Mitchell,The service was superb. Our waiter supplied us service with a smile and advice that we took. Fried lasagna was the best lasagna I've ever eaten. Calamari had too much salt. Could have been I eat little to no salt.,5
11,Da Marino NYC,"220 W 49th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.2,Nia Gaillard (Mint),"I LOVE IT HERE !

Such an amazing experience with culture and love ! Cheers literally when you come in such a beautiful bar. I love the piano and the music . It was cinco de mayo and we still came to have a drink. They did a two for one on a Sunday! ❤️❤️❤️ absolutely amazing. The bread is so so good and warm. I never felt so loved before please visit !",5
12,Da Marino NYC,"220 W 49th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.2,Sara Van Hooreweghe,"Loved our time at this beautiful restaurant!  A warm, cozy and Italian atmosphere!  Go try it out for an excellent Italian dinner!  Meatballs are delicious and dessert was amazing!  Try the tiramisu! Pianist was an added special touch to our evening at Da Marino!",5
13,Da Marino NYC,"220 W 49th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.2,Gregory Barbosa,"If you’re a fan of traditional Italian food, look no further. Da Marino is THE spot for your Italian fix. The food is made fresh daily and the flavors are exquisite. Our table had the pleasure of eating several delectable dishes throughout the night — we ended up spending the entire time passing our plates around the table and sharing everything. The calamari was delicious and the the pasta dishes were mouth-watering. And don’t get me started on the complementary freshly-made bread and lentils — an amazing duo! And the drinks were delightful - a perfect pair to each plate. We finished with the most yummy desserts - I’m not even sure how we made room for it all. In addition to the excellent food and drinks, the staff was super friendly and made us feel at home. Special shoutout to Tom, the manager, who took care of everything and anticipated every need before we even knew we had them. The servers, bartenders, and live pianist were also super lively and friendly. Will be coming there again and again and again!

*Bonus points: There is an amazing pianted mural of the Les Miserables logo. And great location: right in the heart of Times Square. And the owners of the restaurant are super warm and welcoming.",5
14,Da Marino NYC,"220 W 49th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.2,Heather,Went to Da Marino for a late lunch before seeing MJ at the Neil Simon Theater. The Calamari was delicious; lite and fresh. We had Ravioli con crema de fungi (ravioli with asparagus and mushrooms) and Lobster Ravioli. Both were delicious. Lovely atmosphere (reminded me of eating in Italy).,5
15,Da Marino NYC,"220 W 49th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.2,Linda M.,"My family of 5 were in NYC to see Hadestown on Broadway. I procrastinated booking a dinner reservation, so when I did, this was the closest one available to our theater (Walter Kerr) that still had times available. I was a bit skeptical (why are there available reservations the day before a Saturday evening Broadway show AND on St Patrick's Day weekend??), but I am SO GLAD we ate here.

We got there at 5:25 for a 5:30 reservation. They weren't quite ready for us, so we had a drink at the bar and chatted with an extremely friendly and efficient bartender who was from the Ukraine (I'm sorry I didn't get your name!). We were seated within about 15 minutes and received excellent, efficient service. The delicious, crusty, complementary bread came not with tomato sauce like I'd expect, but lentils. I LOVE lentils and I had to restrain myself from eating it all.

My family got a variety of pasta dishes off the menu and not a speck was left of them. I got a fish/spinach/green bean special and I was sad I couldn't bring it with me because I couldn't finish it all. It was fantastic! The service was attentive without being overbearing.

It was definitely a typical crowded NYC restaurant (but again, we were there on a Saturday night so it's probably different at other times) and tables were close together. I personally like this ambiance, but if you don't, now you know.

I give this meal an unreserved 5 stars and I wish I lived in NYC so I could go back and try more of their food. We didn't get dessert, but we saw multiple desserts served to other tables and were quite jealous!",5
16,Famous Original Ray's Pizza,"736 7th Ave, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.9,John Elmer,This place has been around for ever! I had pizza here in my early 20s when I was driving cab! It’s solid. They have about 10 choices of different kinds of pizza. I always just go with classic cheese. The dough is good and crispy yet soft. Sauce is upper level and the line goes quickly. Outside seat and a bathroom downstairs are 2 pluses!,4
17,Famous Original Ray's Pizza,"736 7th Ave, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.9,Anthony,"This was my first time trying New York style pizza, and it was the best pizza I have ever had in my life. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to try NY style pizza. It's in a great location, too, since it was super fun to eat pizza right near Time Square. As i said earlier I highly recommend :)",5
18,Famous Original Ray's Pizza,"736 7th Ave, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.9,David Nagel-Nunez,"Great pizza!  My husband goes here almost every time we go to NYC, and he really enjoys their pizza and garlic knots.  He thinks it's one of the best pizzas in the area.  They give pretty big slices, and quick service.  There's some seating inside, but can get limited if it's busy.  Atmosphere inside could use some music though!  It's a bit quiet / awkward.",5
19,Famous Original Ray's Pizza,"736 7th Ave, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.9,Arelys Q,"I recently visited the Famous Original Ray's Pizza in Times Square and had a really good experience. The place is quite small, with just a few tables both inside and outside, and the bathrooms are located downstairs. Despite its size, the service was impressively quick. We were a group of six and ordered two whole pies. The pizza was thin, well-cooked, and very savory. I really enjoyed it and will definitely go back to Ray's Pizza the next time I'm in New York.",5
20,Famous Original Ray's Pizza,"736 7th Ave, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.9,Ron T,"$11 for what you see in photo.
$4.75 single item slice

lol… ok guys… won’t be back… and of course as soon as they sold me the last slice of pepperoni, they brought out a fresh pizza… smh…",2
21,The Harrison Restaurant & Bar,"1605 Broadway, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.3,Jen W,"Good spot for drinks, nice atmosphere and not too crowded. Typical NYC pricing on drink and food. We ordered appetizers before our show. We opted for our chicken tenders & Philly cheese steak egg rolls, they weren't very good- def quick bar food.",3
22,The Harrison Restaurant & Bar,"1605 Broadway, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.3,Amber Renee,"Bar & cafe with pub style food but plenty of option for healthy eating. Server was efficient and genuinely sweet and happy to indulge the mostly tourist crowd by taking photos.  Chop salad was delicious, fries were coldish but after a long flight we ate them anyways. I'm sure they would have swapped them if we asked.",4
23,The Harrison Restaurant & Bar,"1605 Broadway, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.3,Bertrand Ngampa,"Came up because I was having a Billboard in NY Times Square go up so I enjoyed a delicious extra cranberry with a splash of vodka

The gelato was amazing I had the mango sorbet and my cousin had the vanilla .

The drinks and the customer was top tier. The bartender told me her name and that she was Russia from our small talk.

I will not butcher or attempt to spell her name . She was pleasant and had amazing customer service. Not too overbearing and let us enjoy while giving Top Tier service",5
24,The Harrison Restaurant & Bar,"1605 Broadway, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.3,Nicole Kornblatt,"Amazing cheesecake!

We popped in after a show because the desserts in the window looked amazing.

We got the Baklava cheesecake and Tiramisu cheesecake. Both were DELICIOUS!

They did not disappoint. Some of the best cheesecake I can remember.",5
25,The Harrison Restaurant & Bar,"1605 Broadway, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.3,Agnes Giele,"We stopped by just because we were hungry and didn’t want pizza. But 1. We were greeted and served by the most kind server 2. Food was incredible 3. The restaurant is way bigger than it looks from outside and is actually very pretty on the inside 4. Food arrived reasonably quickly

Definitely would suggest it to anyone!!!",5
26,Connolly's,"121 W 45th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.4,Jonathan Caes,Stopped in for breakfast and was not disappointed. I had the Irish breakfast (first time) and it was delicious! My wife had the eggs Benedict and they were also amazing. The staff were friendly also.,5
27,Connolly's,"121 W 45th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.4,Sameet Sapra,"Came in for a bite to eat at a spot open late enough on a Sunday night.

I ordered the French onion soup and the shepherds pie. The French onion soup was super cheesy in a good way, but it was hard to bite without eating so much of it in one bite. The broth and onions though were not cooked and simmered all the way through, so I’ve had better.

The shepherds pie was solid though I felt like the entire dish could have used more salt to bring out the flavors of the meat and the potatoes.

Pretty good value though!",3
28,Connolly's,"121 W 45th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.4,Ryan Knuppel,Great food. Loved this place. Had a nice window seat on the 2nd floor looking out to the NYC streets. Service was good. Quick and affordable. Will go again.,5
29,Connolly's,"121 W 45th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.4,Taniki Richard,"The Irish Pub atmosphere really worked for me. I am a pot pie lover, and Connolly's knows how to make a pot pie! The crust was light and flaky, the sauce was creamy, and the chicken was tender. I tasted my kid's fries and burger and had almost wished I ordered that. The loaded nachos were large enough for two and an absolute delight! Our waiter was a gem! The host was very welcoming aswell. Convient 3-4 minute walk from Time Square main strip. Next time I'm in New York, I'll definitely visit again!",5
30,Connolly's,"121 W 45th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.4,Francesca Pannullo,Great irish pub in the city! We went here to see the the druids - absolutely amazing! Can’t comment on the food as we didn’t have any. Place was bouncing but getting drinks didn’t seem to be a hassle. Band were brilliant and had a good crowd in.,5
31,Applebee's Grill + Bar,"205 W 50th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.9,Sean Hyland,"We just wanted a quick bite to eat after a long day travelling and Applebee’s did do the job. The food was okay, but the service was great. The chips were actually really good. The steak was tough, the boneless bites didn’t really have any flavour and the burger was undercooked, it was very pink. Cocktail was cheap and very nice though.",3
32,Applebee's Grill + Bar,"205 W 50th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.9,Andriy Rshkvn,"The food is traditional for this restaurant chain, but prepared with high quality and tasty.  Great beer.  Great service.  A serious minus is the non-functional men's toilet.  This is why I lowered the overall rating.",4
33,Applebee's Grill + Bar,"205 W 50th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.9,Pablo Orona,"Way more expensive than prior years.
Inflation hit everywhere,  but these guys may have upped the prices more than they should have.
Food is tasteful, place is not as clean as you'd expect.  Bathrooms are somewhat filthy.",3
34,Applebee's Grill + Bar,"205 W 50th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.9,Serena Smith,"We visited here on a Monday just after lunchtime, wasn't too busy,  only a few people in.  Friendly greeting on arrival by Dane, which was lovely and he got us our food in good time.  We had pasta and a side dish of fries and I had a chocolate milkshake and a lovely cuppa. Great surroundings, bright,  clean,  nicely decorated. Loved the little apple carvings out of the backs of the chairs. Food was tasty and milkshake yummy.",5
35,Applebee's Grill + Bar,"205 W 50th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.9,erika Lyn,"We had a phenomenal celebration @ Applebee's on New Year's Eve, First, the staff was courteous,  interactive, and attentive,  they went above & beyond to see that my family and ALL ATTENDED were enjoying the evening.  Second,  the food was scrumptious hot, and on point. Lastly, the entertainment was so fun and added to the night I would come back especially if there staff was bringing the same vibes  high energy.",5
36,Amor Loco,"134 W 46th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.3,Tanisha Morgan,"Met a friend at Amor Loco for Saturday brunch.  It was great!  I highly recommend the French toast.  You don't even need the syrup 😊

Unlimited frozen margs is a good idea, I only had 2 and they were pretty strong.  Keep that in mind.

My friend enjoyed shrimp tacos and unlimited white sangria.

Service is good, and bathrooms are unisex and clean.   This is mid-town NYC so don't even think about parking.

Music is good, and played at a decent level.",5
37,Amor Loco,"134 W 46th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.3,Lizzie Youmans,"Delicious and great service! We got the wings appetizer and tacos. The food was absolutely mind blowing and the service was super fast and kind. Would highly recommend. I agree with top comment on Google Reviews; has to be the best Mexican in NYC!! We got the swirl (marg and sangria mix) and a sangria. Both were delicious, swirl was so strong though.",5
38,Amor Loco,"134 W 46th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.3,Jayelyn Lewis,"Walked in and got a table quickly, the service was quick for a tight scheduled day trip to see the Rockefeller 🎄, and the atmosphere was fitting for the season with Christmas tunes🎶. The decor was very chic with great backdrops for top notch photos📸. My party ordered the Burrito Loco one chicken and one shrimp both came with a little salad that was light and tasty. The Burrito Loco was delicious as well packed with black beans, rice, guacamole, sour cream, and pico de gallo.",5
39,Amor Loco,"134 W 46th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.3,Teresa TandBrie,"Friendly service, cozy atmosphere. More dining tables upstairs.  Nice menu options, the guac and chips were warm and deelish.  The Sopa de Tortillas was very tasty, as were the fish tacos.  It is a good find for when taking in the festivities in midtown.",5
40,Amor Loco,"134 W 46th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.3,Edwin,Delicious food! We ordered the Nachos Amor Loco there are big size and 3 Carnitas tacos. The service was great. Price are a little higher.,4
41,Junior's Restaurant and Bakery,"1626 Broadway at, W 49th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.4,Eugene Lee,"The grand-finale of the day was, of course, the desserts at Junior's! Starting with their Strawberry Flavoured Junior's Skyscraper Ice Cream Soda, it was a deep dive into nostalgia with a modern twist. The perfect blend of strawberry ice cream and whipped cream transported me to a blissful state, reminiscent of childhood joy and summer days. Yet, amidst this sugary dream, the soda itself felt somewhat lackluster, not quite living up to the effervescent fizz I was expecting. It seemed to play second fiddle to the already sweet ensemble on my table, craving a bit more sparkle to stand out. The original cheesecake, however, was nothing short of a masterpiece. It struck a delicate balance between density and creaminess, rich in flavor yet surprisingly light on the palate. Each bite shouted what a NY style cheesecake should be, with its thin layer of sponge cake at the bottom rounding off the experience beautifully. It was as if each bite was carefully crafted to convey the essence of the city itself - bold, sophisticated, and utterly irresistible. Red Velvet Layer Cake, a vibrant contrast of colors and textures. The cheese icing sandwiched between each tender, yet dense layer of cake kept me on a sugar high that I didn't want to end. Each layer a blend of softness and rich flavor that danced on the tongue.",5
42,Junior's Restaurant and Bakery,"1626 Broadway at, W 49th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.4,Karl Lee,"My friends and I stopped by Junior's Restaurant & Bakery at the late hour of 10 pm for a sweet break. The bright, retro-themed interior was welcoming, and a staff member seated us quickly and handed out menus. The items were in a small font, and many dotted lines made it difficult to tell what the prices were.
Our Famous No 1 Original Cheesecake: It had the potential to be great but was taken straight from the cake fridge. The cheesecake itself was decent, but nothing exceptional. The slice had rough edges, and certain bites had an unexpected fermented flavour, which was odd.
Red Velvet Layer Cake: Visually appealing with bright red layers, it boasted a fluffy and moist texture. Again, it came straight from the fridge, making the frosting pretty firm for my liking. I would have preferred it slightly warmer.
The interior of the restaurant was spacious and clean, including the bathroom. The server was friendly and attentive, refilling our coffees every now and then.
In terms of value, I noted that the prices were high compared to my overall experience. I may return, but it would not be my first choice.",3
43,Junior's Restaurant and Bakery,"1626 Broadway at, W 49th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.4,natasha rene'e,"This was such a fun experience. We really enjoyed the whole vibe of the restaurant. We had been meaning to try the one by our hotel in Brooklyn, but didn't have the time so we were thrilled to stumble onto this location. The drinks (Brooklyn Old Fashioned & Margarita) were great and the loaded potato pancake was delicious. We got the strawberry cheesecake delivered to the hotel later that night. The strawberries and gel weren't that great but the actual cheesecake was perfect. I would definitely try this place again if I'm back in town.",5

The diabetic friendly cheesecake was incredible! I’d definitely go back for that alone it was so good!
It’s a great place to eat.  Expect a wait if it’s anywhere close to a standard meal time.",5
45,Junior's Restaurant and Bakery,"1626 Broadway at, W 49th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.4,Faidon Kefaleas,"We happened to end up to this place after our Broadway show on Broadway theater. This was the only place we found open on a Tuesday night around 10:45pm.
We waited for about 5 minutes to be seated. The waitress came right away and she was so warm and kind! She handed over the menu which is very long and has too many different options to choose from.
We ordered one cheeseburger and one plate of the homemade chicken tenders.
The burger had no flavor although it was cooked in the right temperature -I asked for medium. The onion rings were soggy and the tomato was pink to white. Fries were so so.
The chicken tenders were burnt! For this reason we asked the server to bring us a new order. She assisted us right away and after 10 minute a new plate arrived. This time they were edible.
The interior is full of red and orange colors.
I wish a had a great experience so I could give a better review.",3

51,Little Italy Pizza,"167 W 48th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.3,Chichén Itzá,"Every bit as good as the Google reviews said it would be. With the line outside and part way down that street. It moved along relatively quickly, and in less than 30 minutes, we had our pizza slices! This was on a Friday night at 5 pm.

It's a big operation and very popular. Customers generally moved on quite quickly, too, so finding somewhere to eat wasn't a problem.

Pizzas are served by the slice or a whole pizza, and you can order via their website ahead of time for a whole pizza only. We got 4 slices for 2 adults, which was a lot! Lynne and I finished every crumb.

It's a well-oiled machine and the staff are super friendly. Look forward to returning next visit! 🍕

4 1/2 Stars",4
52,Little Italy Pizza,"167 W 48th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.3,Jorge H.,"Pizza was ok, the crust and taste were fine. It’s a basic place to grab a quick bite, no frills. A bit pricey for what it is, but if in hurry and no crowds in line it’s ok. They offer a large variety of pizzas, staff is not very patient, they expect you to know what everything in display is, and you better order quick… would not go there again… went there because it was on our way after a Broadway show.",3

The tables and restroom were a bit dirty, however.",4
56,Revel and Rye Bar and Restaurant,"Located on the 8th floor of the New York Marriott Marquis, 1535 Broadway, New York, NY 10036, USA",3.7,Robert Velarde,This was one of the best burgers I have ever tried in my life. I don't think there is anything that can be as delicious as what I tried here. Their drinks were great and the view from the restaurant is amazing. It's expected of New York City but the prices were extreme and just a tad bit cheaper would make it a perfect place. The other thing as well is that the salad happened to be the most expensive item because we added chicken to it which just seems a bit weird that a Caesar salad could be the priciest item just because of some chicken.,4

The service was attentive, with staff members being knowledgeable about the menu and providing helpful recommendations.
While my experience was overall positive, I'm withholding the fifth star for a minor hiccup in the pacing of service. There were moments where the wait between courses felt a bit longer than expected. However, it didn't overshadow the great flavors and atmosphere.",4

The food was good but the service was average or below average. The chicken was well cooked but the sauce was too sour for me. The side potatoes & veggies tasted like they were a day old and reheated. I took one bite of them and didn’t eat the remainder. However, I ate all the chicken and Brussels sprouts with bacon. My husband loved the scallops and sweet potato fries.
Our waitress was not overly friendly and didn’t check in on us most of the meal.",4

Her suggestions were right on for the wine, the entrée, and the dessert.  I know there are comments here about the service, but mine was excellent. The only drawback is I wasn’t crazy about where the table was and people were talking very loudly around me, but that’s not the restaurants fault. I would eat the same thing again. This was good",5

I ordered the Southwest Chicken Salad and it was absolutely delicious—perfectly seasoned with just the right kick. The bartender was super friendly, adding to the great atmosphere. The place itself is well-suited for large gatherings, with multiple floors and plenty of TVs to catch up on sports or news. Definitely a top spot in NYC for both drinks and dining!",4

We got an old fashioned, chicken fingers, the hummus plate, and the spinach and artichoke dip, and everything was frankly terrible. The old fashioned was so bad she didn't finish it. Regarding the spinach dip plate, the dip itself was so watery it was practically a soup and had very little flavor, the pita bread was flavorless, and the carrots were mushy and wilty. My chicken tenders plate had some of the worst honey mustard I've ever had, and three of the six pieces of chicken had large gristly chunks in them. The hummus plate would have been the only tolerable option, except it had a long hair wound through it that was neither mine nor my wife's, and the veggies were also mushy and sad. We ended up paying $65 for a meal so bad we only ate about 40% of it. I will not be coming back and would absolutely not recommend it to anyone.",1

I would stop back again when in the neighborhood.",4

The reuben makes me ashamed that I have made compliments about those from other places. The regulars treated me like I was one of them.  A port and cheesecake to finish the night.,5

It made for a great experience. Ironically, they also have some of the best New York style pizza in New York. My youngest daughter is a pizza bigot, and she loved this pizza. Despite catering to the tourist crowd, if you're in Times Square do yourself a favor and stop by here just to take a break and enjoy the fun environment.",5

72,Carmine's,"200 W 44th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.5,Aldo Guzman Rosete,Really good food but be very aware of the size of the servings. They are no joke. The Salad itself is large enough for a everyday dinner. We were a party of 4 and just with the Salad and appetizers we were good to go. Keep that in mind when ordering. Place is a little loud but the location is fantastic.,4

The portions at Carmine's are not just generous; they're downright impressive. Each dish that graced our table was served in quantities that could easily satisfy even the heartiest of appetites. It's a testament to their commitment to ensuring every guest leaves fully content.

But it's not just about quantity here; quality reigns supreme. Every bite of our entrees and appetizers was bursting with flavor and made with the utmost attention to detail. From the perfectly seasoned sauces to the tender cuts of meat, each dish showcased the culinary mastery of the chefs at Carmine's.

And let's not forget about the wine selection! The recommendation perfectly complemented our meal, elevating the dining experience to new heights.

Overall, our visit to Carmine's Restaurant was nothing short of exceptional. If you're looking for a place in NYC where you can enjoy delicious food, generous portions, and impeccable service, look no further than Carmine's. It's a dining experience you won't soon forget!",5

Server Ashley was very friendly. It was two of us and since everything is family style we picked the sausage and broccoli  rigatoni with red sauce to share, it was delicious. We took home more than we ate. Complementary bread and butter also yummy. I would love to go back with a big group to share all the things.",5

When we ate the food, it was sub par. The Big Mac was mushy and did not have the consistency of beef whatsoever. The chips were over salty and the drink was pretty tasteless.

Go somewhere else and get better quality if you want a quick bite to eat.",2

I got the #6, a chicken cutlet combo with noodles combined with chicken karrage and soda on the side. This was certainly one of the larger dishes which surprised me but I still enjoyed it to it's entirety as it filled me up. One small complain would be that the broth was overdone as it made parts of the chicken exposed to it soggy and I had to be careful not to risk any spillage but other than that, it was tasty. Urban Hawker right now is 4/4 and there are so many other vendors left to try.",5

83,White Restaurant,"135 W 50th St, New York, NY 10020, USA",3.9,Aloysius Chan,"Singaporean here who frequents the original store in Sembawang, SG. This was very disappointing compared to the quality in their branches in Singapore.

1. The beehoon’s gravy was way too watery and oddly sweet. I’d attribute the success of the original store to their thick, flavorful and savory gravy that no other store in Singapore could compete with, but unfortunately, this was not it
2. The chilli was also very different from that in their original store. It lacks the sharp and tangy taste to it, and tasted much more like store bought hot sauce
3. The ingredients used in the beehoon were lacking too. Pork was too lean and tough. It is also missing the squid, which I think is an essential part of this dish too

For people who have not tried the dish in their Singapore branches, it’s actually not a completely terrible replication of the dish. However, for someone who knows the flavor profile of their brand, this is just not it, and they can do much better.",2
84,White Restaurant,"135 W 50th St, New York, NY 10020, USA",3.9,Mark Pang,I ordered the #1 original white bee hoon. The flavors were amazing and authentic. BUT the chicken was a little dry and tough. Still good overall.,4
85,White Restaurant,"135 W 50th St, New York, NY 10020, USA",3.9,John Duong,"Came across this place in the food hall, the menu pictures on the wall looked amazing. I was nostalgic for Singaporean food that I had years ago when I was in Singapore so figured I give the place a try. Ordered the Premium Seafood Be Hoon and it was quite bland, maybe because they Americanized it for the average Joe who can’t take the heat and spice. Singaporean food is usually quite spicy and very flavorful. The mixed seafood tasted fresh but they were simply boiled and then slapped onto the noodle and broth rather than having been cooked in the broth so the flavor seeped into them.  I didn’t recognize the dish when my order was ready and had to ask to make sure it was my order as it didn’t look like the plate on the menu. Service was friendly though, I would give their photographer five stars for the menu photos!",3

The food was so good that the manager came over and actually bought the chef over to our table so we can complement him. The music was great, the drinks was nice and strong and the overall experience was amazing! When I first arrived, I had a birthday gift that was a bottle of champagne in it although it was wrapped security said they would hold it for me because no bottles are allowed inside of the restaurant which is totally understandable. When we left the security guard was still smiling and joking and gave us the bottle of champagne that he was holding without issue. I love the fact how they check IDs and it was really just an overall great experience. I am looking forward to going to their sister lounge in Brooklyn Native. Thank you for a wonderful evening.",5

The margarita was a little sour but strong for the happy hour price. The service was excellent. Never a dirty plate on the table for too long, food came in a timely manner and served with gloves. Overall it's a nice vibe but PLEASE BE AWARE that for the taste and portion of the main entrees, it is extremely pricey!! You are essentially paying for the city and the atmosphere. This is in fact overhyped. There are definitely better African food restaurants with more affordable prices. Also keep in mind you are charged 20% gratuity on not only dine in orders but take out orders as well. It's a nice place for birthdays and events but this is the type of restaurant you go to once for the experience.",3

She recommended us some authentic Nigerian dishes. It’s seasoning and taste that you’ve never had before. Grab a few cocktails, some starters, with entrees and watch the game! For those who like to explore, try their peppered snail imported from West Africa. Other authentic dishes include Peri-Peri Chicken and their Lagos Fried Rice with your choice of protein.

To make matters worse, despite repeating our order several times, the staff still got it wrong, and we had to send part of our order back.

To add to the chaos, there was an apparently intoxicated individual in the establishment who also appeared to be injured.

The restaurant shares a bathroom with the club next door which was easy enough to find.

Super cute decor around the restaurant. Dim lighting makes it romantic :)

It was 4 pm. on a Sunday, and we were seated by these beautiful wine racks. We all ordered different drinks and different entrees. There was some sharing, and we all agreed the food presentation was amazing and wonderful. All the staff was incredible, considering there were so many choices it took us a while to order. The prices were equal to other restaurants in the area.",5

120,Dos Caminos,"1567 Broadway, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.0,Eric Walters,"I ordered the chicken fajitas that were very good but a little skimpy on the rice, beans and tortillas for a $30 meal. Very loud at peak hours but a cool vibe.  Server kept us waiting and we had to ask others for water refills and for the bill. No free chips and salsa but worth the $5 to get their salsa that had a heavy garlic flavor. Dessert was a disappointment which was the chocolate lava and ice cream. Small and not that good.",4

We've been there on a Saturday's evening, and it was easy to get a good table. Menu is limited for food - we've had the Truffle Fries and the Chicken Tenders, and both were good enough. The place offers a good variety of beers, and service was good - although there seem to be few people than needed to take care of all the tables.",4

Very friendly service and good food. The Rosemary Mushroom Burger was flavorful and meaty, only downside was the bun was a bit dry. A fresh and yummy bun would've made this a 5-star. Same with the hot dogs, good dogs with sauerkraut and mustard, but the buns were a bit stale too. Still a great find because it was not super busy and it had quick and friendly service.",4

The staff are a little abrupt but honestly they are really busy so it makes sense. They do at least take the time to answer your questions and even pointed out all the veggie dishes for me.

Food: Food is excellent. It comes out really fast but you can tell that it's fresh. The noddles are oily as expected but the dim sum is amazing! We got a lot of the steamed items and it was so good.

Price: Such a great price considering the amount of food you're getting.

Atmosphere: This is definitely a super casual place.

Overall, it was decent but nothing stood out from any other Cuban restaurant I’ve been to. The service was mediocre, and the food was average. I enjoyed my empanadas, the Three Cheese was the best. Everything else was a bit dry. Any refills on drinks had to be requested. It is a very noisy establishment, but I also want to call out that it was clean.",3

The staff working that day were absolutely incredible and accommodated us perfectly. Food came fresh and hot. No complaints and everything tasted insanely good!!! Top tier restaurant and for sure worth the money. Can’t wait to come back for those empanadas!!!! We of course had to try the dessert and it was exquisite as well.

I also want to mention the music is loud, which I didn’t mind at all, but if you’re sensitive to loud sounds I would be cautious! There’s also plenty of TVs for those sports lovers out there.",5

The only reason for any stars was for the Cuban Sampler. I got the monthly special dish, braised oxtail. Highly disappointed and I DO NOT recommend. When receiving the plate the first thing I looked at was how poorly presented it was. It looked like the meat was thrown in. As I was eating I had to practically search for the meat from all the fat. Basically paid $27 for rice and fat.
The rice is not good. The rice is way too wet, mushy consistency. & it was the same for my partners dish.

We told the waitress and she apologized, but it should have honestly been a better solution than a piece of cake given all the money we spent.",2

I have Celiac so I need to be careful when dining out. The food was good, but the real treat were the singing waiters. I didn't realize this when I chose the restaurant, but the waiters actually walk around and sing Broadway tunes. The performers of Gayle's Broadway Rose were amazing, such talent! It was dinner and a show all at once and we loved every minute of it! This evening was one of the highlights of our NY trip. We'll definitely be back next time!",5

We split a Chicken Parmigiana and got a side of broccoli rabe. Both were quite good. Their pre meal bread was good but was served with lentils in olive oil. Certainly an interesting idea, but difficult to get the lentils on the bread.

Service was very good and the atmosphere is nice. This is not a Manhattan restaurant where you feel you are jammed into a tight spot.

We skipped dessert since we only went for lunch.",4

Service wasn’t good at all, the waiter wasn’t able to describe the difference between the Chef’s set of 4 dishes and a la carte menu, he was only repeating ‘portions in a la carte are bigger, Chef’s set is smaller’… I was waiting to hear some recommendations, what is the must in this venue or what specials they have tonight…

So we went by a la carte…
Yellowtail crudo/Seared octopus/Lobster scampi pasta… the only reason that I put 2 stars in the food instead of 1 was Yellowtail, it was really good 👍🏻 , octopus - way too small for a $30 appetizer, amd grilled too much… Lobster scampi, their flagman $50 pasta was a bit over salted (that ruined the whole taste) and too fat.

Overall - it is definitely not the seafood Mecca, just a regular, a bit overpriced huge seafood place in the office area.",2

We wanted seafood. Someplace elegant, but not too much. Oceana was a perfect fit. Loved the warm and cozy atmosphere. You enjoy fine wine. They have a deep selection with expert advice.

I went before a Off-Broadway Show and had the Prix Fix menu.  The salad was delicious.  There were apples, pears, goat cheese, and baby greens in it along with hazelnuts. The Skirt Steak was delicious, but had a little spice kick to it. Very mild.  It came with carmelized onions that were very spicy, some baby greens that were also spicy and an amazing rice pilaf. Asparagus was the vegetable and it was delicious. For dessert, I had the Raspberry Sorbet that was to die for.  I did find that you could make a delicious drink with the Sorbet and some vodka! I also had the French Onion soup, which I found to be very average, sort of like what you would find in a diner. Great view of Times Square.  The ambiance was very nice.",4

Kids 6-12 pay half price and under 6 eat free with a paying adult. There's a great selection of juices and cereals. A good hot station of food. The fruit could definitely be better than the pineapple and 2 types of melon each morning.  The bread is quite nice and the place is amazing. The views of Times Square and the fabulous, upscale restaurant is great! The three things that would make this place better is if there was an omlette station like most hotel restaurants, better assortment of fruit and if they had brown sugar for the tea or coffee.

The portion sizes are great and the atmosphere is fun the feel of a diner that’s been around for decades. American food and cheesecake is what this place is known for. If you’re looking for a place to sit down and eat that’s close to Times Square without the blaring music and flashy lights you can’t get away from, this is the place for you. Tip - if you get fries, ask them to be cooked longer than they usually cook them to get a crisper fry while keeping their soft inside. Also if you order the BLT, expect an obscene amount of bacon (good!). Generally, I’d say the service here is also good. I e been several times and it’s a place I plan to come back to.",4

But don’t discount all the delicious burgers and great food that comes out of this place too!! We decided to go not with the whole cheesecake but a few of the amazing selection of cheesecake goodies they have.. we of course had to get the plain which by the way nothing plain about it.. it was creamy and tangy and just delicious..next was the red velvet cheesecake so soft and moist.. then came the carrot cake cheesecake omg this was so good with cinnamon and ginger and cream cheese frosting and a layer of amazing cheesecake… can’t forget the devils food cheesecake with the layers of soft chocolate cake fudge frosting and chocolate cheesecake I couldn’t stop eating it… the brownie cheesecake wasn’t my favorite because the brownie was hard and crumbly and didn’t go with the creamy cheesecake but still good… so many more to choose from so we will have to go back and try more at a later date…,5

It was a waste of money. My girlfriend got sick because the the food was disrespectfully spicy. Chunks of spicy red pepper will destroy your buttocks. the food here is like if your wife or husband that is a bad cook said “Hey Babe I made Chinese tonight”! The spice levels don’t make any sense and will probably spoil your eating experience. I don’t recommend this place at all.

What a great deal for weekend dinner!
Calamari with chili sauce was delicious and portion was huge. Meatball appetizer was great!
My daughter’s filet mignon was amazing. Mashed potatoes and perfectly roasted medley vegetables were great accompaniments.
My steak with chimachirri sauce was tasty.
My husband’s short rib with risotto had lots of flavor, but risotto was little salty.
Dinner came with dessert: cheese cake, brownie a la mode, sorbets were all delicious.
Service was impeccable. They really know how to take care of customers. It was a pleasant, great dinner!",4
187,Bobby Van's,"135 W 50th St, New York, NY 10020, USA",4.3,Heather Shaffer,"Wasn't supposed to go to this location, but instead, the one on 45th St. Nevertheless, because my reservation was at 9 pm and they closed at 10 pm, I sat down to eat. The restaurant was very quiet, only 5 other tables seated in the restaurant. Our server Marco G was very nice and pretty attentive.

I generally won't visit a chain steakhouse in the city because there are just so many other options, but I needed something close and convenient.

We ordered thick cut bacon, french onion soup, crab cocktail, lobster cocktail, meatballs, and chef bacon cheeseburger. The french onion soup had no taste/flavor. I didn't even know it had onions in it other than seeing them in the crock. The bacon was great but comes with a basalmic glaze that isn't noted on the menu. Crab cocktail was ok, nothing to really write home about. However, it was better than than the lobster cocktail. The lobster was tasteless and almost seemed that it had been sitting in water, it was overcooked. The server didn't bring a shell bowl until asked to do so. The meatballs were tasteless as well. We only ate 1.5 out of the skillet. Lastly, the burger, I paid more for the chef burger because I wanted the aged Vermont cheddar, but the cheese seemed to be one step up from a kraft single. I asked for the bacon to be well done. There was a half a slice of bacon on the burger, leaving half of the burger with no bacon. To take the cake, the burger was well done when I ordered it medium. It was dry, and I mustarded through to just a little less than half of it. When Marco asked if I wanted it boxed I explained to him that it was well done. He went over to his manager. However, when the check came, the burger was still listed.

This wouldn't have been a big deal if I wasn't paying for soup that I only ate 4 /5 sips of meatballs that we only ate 1.5 of and then the burger. I am extremely disappointed if the kitchen is tired and feeling overworked than get new kitchen staff or close the restaurant.

I could have honestly had a better meal at Chipotle or McDonald's. I won't be back... very disappointed on how the management handled this tonight.",2

I had a filet and for $60, I expect it to be perfect. For me, there was too much connective tissue and just a bit too much fat. My husband’s sirloin was good, but again, not great. The service was good, but I felt our waiter was a bit condescending and I did not feel welcome. Perhaps this is because we were not locals. In the positive side, the cauliflower mash was delightful and the poached pear we had for dessert was exquisite!

After 1 hour it was brought out cold. Flat bread pizza; crispy shrimp and mac n cheese. We requested hot food and was told it would be right away. 45 minutes later it still had not been served. We were told by our waiter that he was busy and we were not his only customers. Tables on both sides of us had been flipped twice. I told him to cancel and he gives me a bill for $52 I went to management and said I am not paying for this and he told me to GO SO I DID AND I AM NEVER COMING BACK!!!!,1

Got the 3 eggs and toast for breakfast, had to ask for the toast. Eggs fine, can't do anything wrong with them. Bacon, ok. Toast was clearly pre made earlier the morning, floppy and half-warm.
Other half of the table had the pancakes with fruit. Not to much fruit on the plate, pancakes were not the best.

As said before, staff is kinda slow. They're looking around a lot, but seeing very little. All friendly though.

Thing you have to watch out for, is that there is already a ""service tip"" included in the bill. And the suggested tips are over that amount as well.

Sides were the adobo rice and jolly spaghetti. As part of the combo you got a biscuit and side of gravy and chose the pineapple quencher for my drink. I added the spicy chicken sandwich and a peach pie. I wasn’t a fan of the spaghetti which was sweet and had sliced hot dogs in it. Everything else was ok. They forgot my peach pie however. The combo meal, not counting the sandwich and pie was $20 by itself and wasn’t worth it. The total cost for everything was about $32.

201,P.S. Kitchen,"246 W 48th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.6,sunny shandilya,"PS Kitchen is a small blink-and-miss restaurant near the world-famous Times Square Garden. While we were exhausted walking around craving a vegetarian meal, we stumbled upon this place, and here is the summary of our review:

My actual rating is 3.5 but because they made us wait so long, it was an unpleasant experience.

1) Ambiance 4/5: The place is small but given the location, they have done well to maintain the ambiance of this place

2) Service 2/5: This is by far my biggest sore here. We had to wait for over 30 minutes for a burger and burrito on the pretext of it being about to be closed and they didn't even give us the extra sauce which we asked and they even mentioned in their bill. This was disappointing as they could have stopped entertaining guests if it was too late.

3) Food 5/5:  Here is the summary of the food we had. The food was really tasty and filling.

a) Beyond burrito: Great if you are looking for a filling single meal. It has great taste.

b) PS burger: Again a juicy and great vegan burger with beyond patty and cheese

4) Value for Money 4/5: Not the cheapest place as simple burritos and burgers and about $18 but given its location, it would not be cheap.

Overall, great tasting vegan food but not the best service experience and if you are looking for something cheap, try one of the local shops around.

When I am back in NYC, I will definitely give it another try in hopes of changing my views about it",3

I arrived shortly after they opened, so was seated immediately. Upon the recommendation of my server, I ordered the Beet Salad with ""Chicken"" and avacado, along with the Crabby Cakes appetizer. Both dishes were amazing. So flavorful and texturally satisfying. I highly endorse both. Reservations are recommended before shows; evening and matinee, but well worth the extra effort. With so many excellent dining establishments in Manhattan, I tend not to go back to the same restaurant. P.S. Kitchen will be an exception to this rule.",5

Now, the price for entry was a bit ridiculous, but I guess they had to make their money somehow. Our tickets cost us $53.80 per person.  I thought since we didn't purchase the $36.50 tickets, it would come with a free drink and maybe an appetizer - nope, not at all. The $53.80 was for entry fee, and I guess a $13.50 santa hat that would have cost you 1.99 at the dollar store.  The drinks were over-priced for the small cup they gave you. The 🍔 we ordered was dry, and the total was $51.00 + tax and a $10.20 gratuity.  You would think for the price they charged for the burgers, they would have had a bottle of ketchup....nope we were given packets. Thank GOD for Jarvis, the manager. She made us 2 very, very strong Long Islands on her and took 50% off the bill. We only paid $37.96. Don't get me wrong, after getting over the ticket price and food , we started to take pictures and make the best of it. We met a mother and daughter from Boston, and they even thought the prices were high. The bottom floor was the place to be.

I wish they had the ingredients listed or at least mention what is dairy free, sugar free, etc. When we asked the girl behind the register, she had no clue. We had to do the guesswork to figure out what had sugar and not. Later we saw that the website has all ingredients listed, so you may want to check that out if you have allergies.

**Food (2/5):**
While Chick-fil-A is known for its delicious chicken offerings, the ones I had during this visit fell short. The taste seemed a bit off, and it wasn't as flavorful as my previous experiences. It's disheartening when a favorite restaurant doesn't meet expectations.

**Service (3/5):**
The service was decent, as the staff were friendly and efficient. However, the overall experience was marred by the lackluster food quality.

As always, Chick-fil-A maintained a clean and inviting environment. The restaurant was well-maintained, and the staff seemed diligent in keeping the space tidy.

**Overall Experience (2.5/5):**
While I've had great experiences at Chick-fil-A in the past, this visit was a letdown. The subpar food overshadowed the positive aspects of service and cleanliness.

Runs like a well oiled machine and handles high volume without compromising quality or standard. Would eat here every day if I could! The tacos are so flavorful, pork was probably my favorite but they are all excellent. Prepare to wait in line because this place gets busy but it is worth the wait!

We ordered two each of chicken and beef corn tacos we did have to wait a while before we got ours even though people behind us in the line got their food first but apart from that the experience was excellent.

It is busy so be prepared to queue but it went down fast. Only standing tables available as well so it can be crazy to find a spot as it’s so busy. But the business is a testament to how good the food is. They have a good system for ordering. You get given a ticket then you hand it to one of the chefs. They work super super quick and really hard.

Would highly recommend but be prepared it is also messy food so don’t wear white like I did 😂",4

231,The View Restaurant & Lounge,"1535 Broadway, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.2,Larry Snider,"First time in NYC! Traveling with some friends who had ate at previously and highly recommended The View. They had attended prior to the epidemic and experienced the revolving floor that added to the dining appeal.

Sad to say that the floor no longer turned and menu was set, everyone eats the same thing, so hopefully you liked everything being served on the menu because there are no substitutions. In exchange for the revolving floor, you got a “show” of a miniature chef preparing each course that they bring out to you.

While the staff was friendly and attentive and the meal presentation was cute, we were stunned and less than impressed by our enormous bill. For two people the bill was well over $400 which was more than our round trip flights to the city!! We were totally shocked and thrown off by this, as was our friend who had been a patron there before! She said that every about this experience had changed and was nothing like she remembered and wanted to share the experience again with us.

Beware before booking your reservation as this is NOT budget friendly and you will want to make sure your taste buds align with the menu. This is not something I would recommend to a friend as I am sure there other nice eating establishments that would cost far less!",2
232,The View Restaurant & Lounge,"1535 Broadway, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.2,Jacques Moscianese,"Very disappointing. First of all it would be important to inform the clients that tables are maximum for 4 ppl. If you are more than four you will be separated if you want to enjoy the virtual show. Unacceptable especially if you are a family with kids because the family will be split.
Secondly the level of service is very poor and the personnel is clearly non trained for a supposed high-level restaurant. During the waiting time for the preparation of the table, the personnel offers you a cocktail (nobody told us what it was, and I have assumed that it was a Spritz, but not sure! Nothing have been offered to our 3 kids) and some appetizers. They put everything on the desk at the entrance and don’t go through the various clients.
Food quality is medium-high, but clearly no wow. Wine pairing is a nightmare. The wine chosen for every dish is simply horrible..Unacceptable for Europeans! Please allow clients to chose a bottle of wine or to pay more to have better quality.
At last, we wait 10 minutes (!!!) in a queue to have the elevator and go out…we were waiting for a lady from the restaurant with a badge which allows to call the elevator. Crazy!
Animation and virtual show was funny.
At the end the price is too high for what you get. And giving a French sounding name to the restaurant will not improve the quality.",1
233,The View Restaurant & Lounge,"1535 Broadway, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.2,David Thomas,"This was our second time here with our family, but the first since Covid and the first since La Petite Chef. The bottom line is while still a superior restaurant, the price does not reflect much more than the payment to restore the spinning restaurant mechanism that makes ""the view"" worth it in the first place.

Please note, and if you've seen our other reviews, you know that, at All Set Vacations, we pride ourselves on providing true and transparent editorial content based on all my years as a journalist and educator.

We paid $1200 for this experience.

Definitely arrive early. We shared drinks a snack in one of the lower floor restaurants first because we read that it might not be enough food, it definitely was enough food and the wine at dinner was also enough alcohol to suffice anyone.
By arriving early, we enjoyed three different appetizers. They were ok, but mostly breading, so, nothing special.

The show is cool, but, as a photographer and cinematographer/media person myself, felt a bit dated. Essentially, there is a ultra high resolution projector above your table with four specifically placed circles that mark your plate. That way the projector can the two-dimensional animation at the same time to all four place settings. It's a simple two-dimensional cartoon chef that runs around and you enjoy his antics for a few minutes as he prepares what you're about to eat and then the food is served right afterwards. That's pretty much it. It was cool but nothing that was mouth dropping or eye opening other than just being a novelty. It would definitely be worth a look to do it once but not sure if it warrants the heavy price tag. I'm not sure if I would recommend coming here just for this part alone. However, the food, plus this experience, depending on your preference for something different could make it worth it.

Now for the food itself at dinner. The food was amazing, but, heavy! How anyone can say they didn't feel they ate enough is beyond me! The cream base on many dishes filled us up and we definitely felt it! The portions are fine. I did a little digging and looked up each one of the pairing wines individually. They are all very highly ranked and we're all delicious. We have more of a preference for red and we know a bottle of stag sleep alone is a $100 bottle. So having two glasses of that was wonderful. Put that together with all the other ones and if you're a wine person, this is like having a high-end flight. I also included a picture of the menu to see all food and beverage offerings.
The dinner courses were fantastic, fresh, and served perfectly. The lobster included a portion of a tail and one claw (would have loved more of that for the price like half of a normal 8 oz tail or skip the rubbery claw even though it helps the presentation). The beef short rib was very tender as well. The first course, again, solid, and the desert was complex and balanced.

So....let's lay it out and see if it gets an 'All-Set' seal of approval.....-after the breakdown.
Let's be generous and assume each wine glass costs $20. For my wife and I, that would be $160 total.
Let's give the first course a $20 price on a normal menu, that's $80 for all four of us.
Second course $30 each normally, $120 total.
Let's assume each main entree of short ribs would be a max of $50 each- $200 total.
And dessert, $20 each or $80 total.
So... for 4 people, 2 adults and 2 kids:
That's $640 for a really wonderful dinner for the four of us at a decent high view of the other tall buildings in the area. ( remember, it's not spinning currently). Add in a tip of 130 and that's $770.

That's essentially a markup of $430 that is likely paying for the projector and, from what we learned, management to save up to turn the spinning motor back on!

Final thoughts: if you can rationalize the extra costs for the experience, do it once but, without the spinning view, the view ( name of the restaurant)! isn't great. But, the food, drinks ,and service is worth $640, but not $1200!",4

There are almost NO Vietnamese dishes so calling it a Vietnamese restaurant is very misleading! I generally try to stay away from Asian fusion restaurants because they often aren't that good. This was pretty decent. The Crispy Rice Spicy Tuna appetizer took 15 minutes (they warned us when we ordered) but was worth the wait. The beef pad Thai wasn't very authentic but with plenty of big pieces of beef and veggies. Yang chow fried rice was bland and I would skip (did have lots of shrimp, roast pork, and ham though!).

I had the vegetable fried rice and that was good. The impossible cheeseburger dumplings were seasoned good. The dumplings 🥟 dough were too thick.

They delivered mostly what they advertised, I’ll get to my only issue in a bit. We had the crispy chicken dumplings which were pretty good but much smaller than expected. The short rib bao buns also gathered no complaints from us except the buns itself could have been warmer.

For the mains we had sweet and sour chicken which was up to par and then the fish (The steamed montauk black bass) it was so delicious, I had the entire thing but I couldn’t shake the feeling of being unsure if it was a bit undercooked or just very soft- Surely enough it was undercooked, because I was feeling very sick the next day.
All that being said, I think I’d have a steak next time and see if it lives up to the name but not a bad experience.",4

When I asked to pay the bill she looked like she was making the amount up. It seemed s little high for what we had, and being a tourist I politely and quietly asked to see the bill and she refused. Saying very loudly in front of everyone in the bar:
“You give me your card, I give you your invoice, that’s how this works.”
It wasn’t busy on a Monday afternoon, there was no need for the attitude.

Decent presentation, but: 1) Online was not ready at the estimated time. While I waited, multiple walk in orders will filled ahead of mine. 2) Quinoa was crunchy and undercooked. Did not eat to avoid a stomach ache. 3) Tofu was very plain and did not taste quite right. Overall the meal was underwhelming and I feel like my money could have been better spent elsewhere.

I have become a regular! I've been pleased with quality of the salads & service I have been receiving recently, and although I still think the prices are a bit high, they really are comparable (or even better) than other options in the area.

The Apple Caramel Crumb Tart and toast were beyond words, simply legit and delicious. It's one of those places that keeps pulling you back in, making you fall in love with it a little more each visit. But the real surprise was the Egg Cream, served up in a delightful vanilla flavor. Contrary to what I initially thought it might taste like (somewhere close to eggnog?), it was wonderfully creamy with a light, velvety, and slightly fizzy texture. The vanilla was hearty and present, making the drink resemble a toned-down milkshake. Absolutely loved it and it's apparently a must-try NY diner classic. The service was attentive, adding to the overall great experience. Although a bit more explanation about the Egg Cream would have been appreciated (it seemed so normal here that our server was a bit stuck on how to describe it), it was a minor hiccup in an otherwise fantastic dining experience.

(I didn’t get a picture of them). My aunt got an omelet and she said it was very good as well. There was a line and we waited maybe 5 mins. The waiter was very friendly and once we ordered the food came out really fast. Highly recommend!!",5

Crowded but staffs handle well, didn’t miss any in my order. Price is bit high compared to other location. Street parking is available but since it’s near time square it’s not that easy for everyone to parallel park.",5
277,Chipotle Mexican Grill,"129 W 48th St, New York, NY 10020, USA",4.1,Alex G,"Had a really satisfying lunch at the Chipotle on 48th Street in Times Square. The location is super convenient, right in the heart of everything, which is perfect for a quick bite. The staff was efficient, and even with a bit of a line, I found the service to be pretty swift. I went with a chicken bowl, and everything tasted fresh. The place was kept clean, and considering the bustle, that's commendable. A solid choice if you're looking for a quick, tasty meal in Times Square.",4
278,Chipotle Mexican Grill,"129 W 48th St, New York, NY 10020, USA",4.1,Brian Alvarez,"Very favorable portions at this location. Staff was nice and very helpful. Some places short you. This place does not. Fountain drinks are self serve. Plenty of seats. Parking in the front, side, or back. Food is always fresh. Will definitely come back.",5

280,Chipotle Mexican Grill,"129 W 48th St, New York, NY 10020, USA",4.1,Ahmed El tantawi,"Delicious Mexican food, 2 min away from Times Square. I recommend the bowl.

You also have options for vegetarian, like the sortiras which is a plant based protein tasting like meat.

The missing star is because the team is a bit negatif",4
281,The Capital Grille,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020, USA",4.6,Stephanie Braganza,"A bit overpriced but much nicer than other restaurants. We had a lovely time and our waiter Tony was amazing. The steak we asked for was medium rare and it was a bit too cooked (more like medium to medium well, not red in the center anymore) but we hate to send steaks back as we know they simply throw those out. Otherwise, the taste and flavors were simply fantastic. Would visit again for an occasion!",5
282,The Capital Grille,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020, USA",4.6,Rodney Klein,"Another great Cap Grille! Wonderful service, very professional. Wonderful steaks. Tried the lamb for the first time and it was amazing. In this time of hard to hire good staff the management of the Cap Grille has done a wonderful job of hiring committed employees that sincerely care.",5
283,The Capital Grille,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020, USA",4.6,Tom,"I highly recommend this one!  The food, atmosphere and service were all amazing!  You can go wrong with pretty much anything on the menu but we decided in the filet, ahi tuna and sea bass.  All of our meal were incredible!  Oh and one of favorites was their old fashion menu!  If visiting NYC check this one out for sure!  You will not regret it!",5
284,The Capital Grille,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020, USA",4.6,Class Personified,"Pricey but worth it. Started off with a dozen oysters and shrimp cocktail then went straight into the entree of Filet minion & Lamb Rib chops cooked to perfection with a few sides of scalloped potatoes, lobster Mac n cheese, Brussel sprouts with thick cut bacon.",5
285,The Capital Grille,"120 W 51st St, New York, NY 10020, USA",4.6,Yolanda Sanchez,"From the moment we stepped into The Capital Grill, we were greeted with impeccable service that set the tone for an unforgettable evening. Celebrating my boyfriend's birthday couldn't have been more special, thanks to the attentive staff who acknowledged the occasion from beginning to end.

The service was exceptional, with every detail carefully attended to. From recommending dishes to ensuring our glasses were never empty, the staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed and appreciated.

Speaking of the food, it was nothing short of amazing. Each dish was crafted with precision and bursting with flavor. From the appetizers to the main course, every bite was a culinary delight.

One of the highlights of the evening was the thoughtful gesture of presenting us with two small desserts and a glass of Champagne to toast to my boyfriend's birthday. It was a personal touch that made the celebration even more memorable.

Overall, our experience at The Capital Grill was outstanding. My boyfriend and I both thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our dining experience, and we're already looking forward to our next visit. If you're looking for exceptional service, delicious food, and a memorable dining experience, look no further than The Capital Grill. We'll definitely be returning soon!",5
286,Moshe’s falafel,"94 W 46th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.6,Mohammed Salim,I got moshe whole falafel and it was good but could have been better if they had put more falafel. I believe just four falafels in an order. Falafels were lost inside bread mixed with other ingredients otherwise taste good. You know food is good when someone old is making it.,5
287,Moshe’s falafel,"94 W 46th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.6,Krishna Narasimhan,"My go to Lunch spot when in the city. I’ve been coming here regularly since 2005 - I first discovered this food truck when I worked in New York. Back then it was a quick walk from my Park Ave. location at lunch time, rain or shine. There has always been a line of people at lunch time but service is quick and efficient. The menu have evolved since I started coming here and it’s fantastic offering. I’ve changed jobs a few times since then and even moved away, but the food truck is still there and serving absolutely delicious food. These days, anytime I’m in the city, I make sure to grab lunch here. It’s a quick walk from our current location on Broadway!!",5
288,Moshe’s falafel,"94 W 46th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.6,Shrenik Ramani,"Don't judge a book by its cover!!!

It might seem like a regular food truck but it's not. They have one of the best Falafel in the town. I tried their whole falafel and was full after one.

They serve vegetarian falafel, plus it doesn't even contain Onion and Garlic which makes it a go-to place for people with dietary restrictions.

They will either take cash or Zelle (have to pay a dollar extra for Zelle) and only have takeaways.

Will definitely visit this place again.",4
289,Moshe’s falafel,"94 W 46th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.6,Damien Bassman,"Fast, super tasty falafel sandwiches and extras. The cauliflower special is totally worth it if they offer it when you visit the truck. Pickles are nice and sour, fries are good, and the pita soft and warm. Highly recommend for a fast bite!",5
290,Moshe’s falafel,"94 W 46th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.6,Vishal Chaudhary,"Another authentic kosher falafel place. It's a small cart in Manhattan but the taste is like a gourmet resturant. I tried half falafel sandwich which was $9.50. while buying one might think that it's expensive to buy just a half sandwich from a cart, but believe me the taste and quantity is far more than one can imagine. Their half sandwich is much bigger than a regular sandwich and falafels are very fresh and delicious. They add french fries also by default, if you don't like it inform them in advance. Also, packaging is very good as compared to other carts. Pro tip: ask for a lot of tissues as it will get deliciously messy !!",5
291,Utsav,"1185 6th Ave, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.0,Rahul Vyas,"Went for Saturday lunch. Nobody at reception, had to go looking for someone to take us to the table. Menus were not given to us for a while and had to request for it. Loud Bollywood music playing. Service was poor. Food was average. Order for rice never showed up and at the end it had to be cancelled. Requested onion in the beginning which came at the end. Charged $3 for some onions and lemon which we were told will come with the food anyway. Empty boxes and a paper bag was left for us to pack our own leftover food which is embarrassing as a customer and surprised that an established high profile midtown restaurant would do this. In spite of the poor service and packing our own food 18% gratuity was mandatory.",2
292,Utsav,"1185 6th Ave, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.0,Stephanie Estremera-Chu,"I love going to Utsav! They always have amazing service and food I can’t get enough of. We ordered the Butter Chicken Kulcha which was stuffed and very flavorful, Kolkata Fish Fry from their new Bengali menu, Chelo Kebab and Chilli Lamb from their IndoChinese menu. I really enjoyed the flavors from each region as I’ve never experienced anything similar before in all of the years I’ve eaten at restaurants in NYC. Needless to say, I will keep coming back to try more from the new Bengali menu as well as their IndoChinese menu. Utsav has won my heart over time and time again!",5
293,Utsav,"1185 6th Ave, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.0,Adam Giladi,"As a passionate foodie living in Manhattan, I always love discovering a new cuisine, and I found a few at this spot in Midtown.

UTSAV is serving up three distinct menus that include traditional Indian delicacies, Indo-Chinese dishes I didn’t know existed, and a new Bengali menu that features some dishes I’ve never tried before but will be back for.

The ambience of this spot makes it perfect for a Friday date night (1st or 100th) and spacious and elegant for a fun work party. We loved exploring this menu and will be back to try some items we didn’t get a chance to.

Absolute highlights were the Tandoori lamb chops, the Bengali deviled eggs, the chicken lollipops, and the saag!",5
294,Utsav,"1185 6th Ave, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.0,Rikki Dewan,Had gone with some friends here. The kolkata Chinese food and the Bengali dishes they serve here are absolutely authentic and to die for ‼️.my veg friend enjoyed the paneer butter masala n we enjoyed the Hakka noodles n mutton kosha n fish fry. Good service. Piping hot food. Definitely cming back soon,5

296,Sombrero,"303 W 48th St, New York, NY 10036, USA",4.4,Arianna Taggart,"The service was attentive and location/atmosphere was very enjoyable. However, the food was pretty disappointing. The 'queso' was a flat skillet of melted (I think mozzarella cheese). It wasn't flavorful and just oily and hard to eat as it quickly cooled.
I ordered the fajitas which came out looking amazing, but the chicken was flavorless and very, very dry. Good veggies. The rice was odd as well, but the black beans were good. The price is pretty high but not outrageous considering the location.",2

The food was good, and the margaritas hit the spot! We got lucky since our daughter met us there and then paid the bill lol. I want to try happy hour next time lol",5

Heavenly Papi Kevin provided great service, make sure to call him that.

Staff in general is really attentive.",5

So we only came in because this guy “Kevin from heaven” assured us that we had to come in and try the “best guac on the city block” and rest assured it was the best I’ve ever had. He recommended the nachos and churros and we were immediately glad we came in! Drinks are refreshing not too strong not too sweet but they packed a punch. We thought we weren’t going to get taken care of right away because it was busy but Kevin was running around like he was in a race. Kevin single handedly make our experience one we will never forget. Great food, better service! Make sure to put this on the bucket list!!",5
