2,The Standard SeaShack,"442 W 13th St, New York, NY 10014, USA",3.3,Robyn,"Terrible experience. I asked the hostess the seat me in the shade, and had to continuously move my table because she failed to put me in the shade, and gave the shaded table to other parties.
The menu fails to tell you what‚Äôs in the food and it comes with unexpected surprises like onions in your eggs. There should never be surprises in a person‚Äôs food on an a la carte menu. I waited for a while after finishing my food before the waiter even came back over. The food is overpriced and not worth it.",1

6,STK Steakhouse,"26 Little W 12th St, New York, NY 10014, USA",4.7,Nikol Hristova,"The staff was amazing, very professional, made lots of recommendations, and was overall very skilled. The food was tasty and came quite quickly, but my steak was a bit too salty for me. In terms of atmosphere, it feels more like a club with loud and dynamic music and it was hard to talk with the people I came with.

Edit: They charged us with additional bottle of wine that we never ordered nor drank! That is why I edited the rating from 4 stars to 1 star. Not professional at all!!!",1

9,STK Steakhouse,"26 Little W 12th St, New York, NY 10014, USA",4.7,Dudy Bar-Tal,"STK consistently impresses, even on a late Sunday night when cravings strike. We arrived famished for steak, and they delivered beyond expectations. The ambiance was inviting, with attentive hosts and a warm staff. Each bite was a symphony of flavors, showcasing their culinary prowess. From perfectly cooked steaks to delectable sides, every dish delighted the palate.

11,TAO Downtown Restaurant,"92 9th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.3,Popo Bee,"One of my favorite restaurants in NYC! It‚Äôs a pretty expensive restaurant but I‚Äôd say that it‚Äôs worth it - so far all the food I‚Äôve had here didn‚Äôt disappoint!

I probably tasted more than 7 dishes here already and all of them are delicious! The vibe is also very sophisticated and classy but if you want to avoid the crowd you should definitely dine in early to avoid the influx of people who are also going to their bar/club.

Also, reserve in advance because it‚Äôs hard to get a table through walk-in because they‚Äôre very popular! And when you get a reservation make sure you arrive on time because they‚Äôre strict with their grace period - u lose the table if u miss it!",5

Honey glazed salmon was delicious, stir fry noodles so flavorful! Can‚Äôt go wrong with any of the selections.  Definitely would go back to try more items!",5
13,TAO Downtown Restaurant,"92 9th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.3,Stephanie Arbelaez,"My favorite place, love to share plates with my friends here and have an amazing experience with the staff. From Connie (receptionist) to Lassaro the server we always have a great time ! So many wonderful experiences I finally had to leave my thoughts on this place. The food is extraordinary- literally 10 plates of food & 5 desserts!!! Everything we have tried is 10/10 can not stress enough how much I love the different flavors and choices for my sister who doesn‚Äôt eat pork - I don‚Äôt eat sea food - but the options are unlimited. We usually are seated on the stairs area (not sure what it‚Äôs called) where the lighting is great but I find the place unique because you‚Äôll have a different experience depending on where you sit but the view and vibes are always incredible. THANK YOU !! üôèüèΩ for always taking care of us. We will always come back for your amazing attention to detail & delicious drink recommendations! Must try the passion fruit cocktail and the huge fortune cookie. The papers inside are so funny.",5

15,TAO Downtown Restaurant,"92 9th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.3,Dayana Londono,"This place it‚Äôs really cool.. I was in love with the atmosphere, so Asian and the low light so charming. We tried different apps and plates.
You would love Hong Kong noodle plate, the portion is very generous and the flavors are perfectly mix together. The sand snapper is stunning with a good spicy flavor.
A lot of different mixtures for the cocktails but without a doubt TAO-TINI my favorite a mix between coconut, raspberry and vodka I have no words.
A totally lovely experience here, I loved it.",5
16,Friedman‚Äôs,"75 9th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.2,Hector Nava,"Let me start by saying this place is good but over priced, the staff were great, attentive, friendly and professional. The food was fresh, tasty and good quality. The burger prices tag as shown on the picture was 36 with fries, total price 61 dollars plus tip which they use the automated tip system so total bill was around 72 dollars, I found it excessive for the type of place but we were pleased with the food, I would say if you on the budget there‚Äôs better options.",4

It is a nice place inside the rush of Chelsea Market but a few feet away from people walking making the atmosphere perfect for enjoyment and relax your feet.",4
19,Friedman‚Äôs,"75 9th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.2,Abigail Adamek,Great spot for breakfast and brunch. Food is always consistent at any of their locations. Staff is very nice and friendly. Turn over is pretty fast for a table.,5

21,The Standard Grill,"The Standard, High Line, 848 Washington St, New York, NY 10014, USA",4.1,Saddmun Ahsan,"Good food, real ""American"" style portions!

FOOD
I thought some of the dishes were quite good. We got an assortment of dishes for the table, including the pancakes which were quite delicious. I got the avocado toast for myself. The toast itself was okay and the avocado had mint running through it which I found to be a bit strange. However, the crispy potatoes were quite delicious and made the entire dish worth it in my eyes. The prices also weren't out there crazy, which I appreciated.

AMBIANCE
The inside of the restaurant was quite spacious. In fact, when you go downstairs it's amazing how much space there really is at this restaurant. There is a large dining area in the back that's more dimly lit, less natural light and has a more moody vibe (that's where we sat). The front of the restaurant is more well lit and reminds me of a diner. Overall, it was a great space and on Wednesday morning there really isn't a lot of people there so we felt we had the entire restaurant to ourselves!

SERVICE
The staff were great and very helpful and attentive. One thing that was unfortunate was that the food came out a bit slow, especially the drinks which was a bit of a bummer.

Overall, very solid place and I can see myself coming back here.",4
22,The Standard Grill,"The Standard, High Line, 848 Washington St, New York, NY 10014, USA",4.1,Augusta Lebech,"The Standard is one of my favourite places to eat in the city.

25,The Standard Grill,"The Standard, High Line, 848 Washington St, New York, NY 10014, USA",4.1,Fandila Quintonla,"People on the reviews are serious haters. This place is as delightful as it ever was. I can‚Äôt imagine what the restaurant owners and staff really endured during covid. We came here for brunch on a Sunday and it was delicious. Lobster roll. White wine. Crisp day. Sunny. Service was attentive. Food was bomb. We came in hungry and left happy. Thank you Standard for a happy Sunday funday. Also, to all the reviewers complaining abt the prices. - why go to a place and complain abt the cost when you know what it costs? You hating and nobody needs that. In post Covid world, we spreading positive vibes, supporting an industry hit the hardest and we bringing back a stronger New York.",5

There‚Äôs usually an afternoon line and long wait time so be prepared. Other than that, way better than other taco places around",4
27,LOS MARISCOS,"409 W 15th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.7,Jenny,"Los Tacos No. 1 is my favorite taco spot. When I found out about this seafood version of their restaurant, I knew I had to try it.

Especial Ceviche - Love the crunchy tortilla bottom and creamy avocado slices on top. Very refreshing.

Fish Taco - The fish was so fresh and fried perfectly. Absolutely delicious.

Spicy Shrimp Taco - Not too spicy. So flavorful and tasty.

It's awesome that Los. Tacos No. 1 is right next door, too. Next time, I'll grab a chicken taco before heading over for another shrimp and fish taco.",5

30,LOS MARISCOS,"409 W 15th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.7,The Foodie Architect,Love this taco place. It‚Äôs part of the chain but they really do it right. Seafood tacos with amazing drinks. There is secret entrance right inside of the Chealsea market. I can‚Äôt wait to come back again.,5
31,Catch NYC,"21 9th Ave, New York, NY 10014, USA",4.0,Joyful Journeys,"Absolutely great and lively restaurant to dine out. It was packed when I was there and a reservation is highly recommended. The fish and sushi are of great quality, as are the meat dishes. There is no need to focus on the signature dishes only, as all the meals we tasted were great. Outstanding selection of US and international wines.",5
32,Catch NYC,"21 9th Ave, New York, NY 10014, USA",4.0,Pedro J Villavert,"This restaurant offers a refreshing take on Japanese cuisine, where raw items taste exquisitely clean and are a testament to culinary mastery. It‚Äôs an innovative journey through traditional Japanese dishes, reimagined with creativity. Our dining experience was elevated by the chef's generosity, gifting our group with an abundance of dishes on the house, showcasing the kitchen's range and flair. While each dish was carefully prepared and presented, the truffle steak, although ambitious, leaned towards the salty side, slightly overshadowing its potential. Despite this, the overall experience was memorable, making it a must-visit for those craving a novel twist on Japanese favorites.",5
33,Catch NYC,"21 9th Ave, New York, NY 10014, USA",4.0,Gemma Mio,Love love love Catch! Not the cheapest place but so worth it - the fish is super fresh and so tasty. Also amazed by the lobster mac and cheese! Cocktails and drinks were really good too. Will definitely be back to try more dishes,5
34,Catch NYC,"21 9th Ave, New York, NY 10014, USA",4.0,Kyle Style,"We wanted to dine at the outside of the rooftop. We were told it's mainly for drinks. Besides, it was chilly that day. So, we ended up dining inside of the rooftop. The 5 of us ordered 2 lush lemonade & a strawberry spritz. The drinks looked great, but I had none of them. Our daughter ordered truffle sashimi & Catch roll with spicy mayo. Can't believe they charged $3 for it. Yhe sashimi is great. I should have used some of the grated Wasabi from the roll with the sashimi. I ate the wasabi with the sliced scallion from the sashimi with the truffle sauce. This alone was marvelous. For the main, my wife got the Scottish salmon, and I got the saut√©ed snapper. Our son ordered the porterhouse with asparagus (these are monstrosities). Both the fish were cooked medium, which is done perfectly to order. It's not often we find fish like these in a restaurant cooked so perfectly. The bad part of the dining experience was that the manager offered us 2 complimentary dishes: pretzel bread & edamame & they didn't take them off the bill. We almost paid for them. Another disconcerting annoyance was the ""suggested"" 20% minimum tips was calculated based on the total bill even we have a credit, which stemmed from a prior visit that did go well. This would mean we would be paying double tips on the credit portion.  Not cool.",4
35,Catch NYC,"21 9th Ave, New York, NY 10014, USA",4.0,Danny Kim,"This is definitely a touristy/special event type of place. Very instagrammy kind of spot in the meatpacking district. There is a doorman where you enter making it feel like you‚Äôre entering a club. You go up in an elevator to get to the main restaurant (evidently there‚Äôs a more lounge-y vibe upstairs but was closed when we went). At night, when we went, the lighting is low and pretty. It‚Äôs a reasonably wide open space but the tables are somewhat packed in together in the middle. The hostess was very pleasant, our waiter was very good - you can tell this is a well run establishment. We ordered Tartare trio, Crispy nori taco, Crispy shrimp, Brussels sprouts,
Grilled Spanish octopus, and the Hit me chocolate cake for dessert. The tartare trio was very delicious (the creamy wasabi is amazing - almost licked it off the dish) and comes with crispy waferish thing for a good crunchy texture. The nori taco was good and the fried nori held its crunch pretty well. The crispy shrimp was ok - just your normal variety of well fried shrimp in a light sauce. The Brussels sprouts were terrific (when aren‚Äôt they?) and plentiful. The octopus was just ok. The dessert was this high-multi component cake thing that the gimmick was that you smack it with a spoon to release the chocolate sauce inside. Fun and interesting different chocolate tastes and textures. Overall - definitely worth a try. Get the tartare trio and the Brussels sprouts for sure!",4

I ordered the chicken sandwich ($7) and it‚Äôs no doubt the worst chicken sandwich I‚Äôve ever eaten. The chicken was hard as rock, I had to add mayo and hot sauce on my own to deal with how dry it was. The sweet potato tots were tasty, but still very overpriced ($7 each tray) for the amount you get. Bring food from outside if you‚Äôre going to come.",1
42,Little Island Kiosks,"Little Island, Pier 55 at Hudson River Park, Hudson River Greenway, New York, NY 10014, USA",2.9,Mark Foster,I am from the Midwest and to see and appreciate the engineering that took to make this place is cool.  I also like the New York dog.  I grew up in Chicago and to have a green space like this and some food trucks to boot.

47,Dos Caminos,"675 Hudson St, New York, NY 10014, USA",4.0,Rachael & Daniel Glover,The actual servers are great but if you come for happy hour beware that the front desk will attempt to seat you in the restaurant where the HAPPY HOUR DOES NOT APPLY. I complained and the manager refunded me $16 on a $120 bill so they did attempt to rectify but still a frustrating end to an otherwise great dining experience.,1
48,Dos Caminos,"675 Hudson St, New York, NY 10014, USA",4.0,Yanira Araujo,"I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt know this place is was a chain until after going otherwise I would have really missed out.  Tortilla soup was delicious.  The canasta nachos were 5 star with so many components.  Taquitos with sweet potatoes were so yummy with the sweet, spicy combo.  I don‚Äôt know what they do to their chicken here but wow!!  Lots of flavor, well balanced, fresh tasting!  The modelo only comes in cans and that‚Äôs a bummer but the spicy tequila drink called something with storm in the title was so good!!",5

The personel is very friendly and helpful, they're bilingual. The downside is that there's not enough seating available. Some seat on the stairs.",5
52,Takumi Taco,"75 9th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.1,Christina Ng,"Bar seating. We were lucky to grab 2 seats as someone else was leaving.  They are very good about checking on you and service was very quick.

We both ordered bento boxes. 2 tacos and a side for $13.78. Not bad for lunch.  That was enough for me. Husband ended up ordering 2 more curry beef tacos.

I got the braised short rib taco, shrimp taco and cucumber side. All were very good. They give you some chips too that have seasoning on them. The chips were perfect to pick up anything that fell out of my tacos.

Check in on yelp and got 10% off. But don‚Äôt do it until you are ready to pay. I checked in when we sat down but the server said we will do it later. When we were ready to pay, it said I couldn‚Äôt check in for another 4 hours. Thank goodness they let me use it. I did show it to him when we sat down.",5
53,Takumi Taco,"75 9th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.1,Anthony Parris,"Don't get the bowls. I've been wanting to come for awhile because I love fusion restaurants. I was highly disappointed unfortunately. I got a burrito bowl with double meat but they drowned it in sauce.  Not only was my bowl soup-like, the sauce was so salty. The curry beef was very tasty despite this but the bowl itself was very unsatisfying. My partner got one too and his bowl was the same. When we told them, they gave us a huge plate of extra rice but unfortunately it didn't really help. I hear the tacos are better so if you come, avoid the bowls and try the tacos for me because I can't return. Service was really good though. 2 stars given solely for the food.",2

The staff were super friendly and accommodating. Jocelyn in particular was super sweet in helping us swap our accidental alcoholic beverage order. She was kind enough to offer us an alternative virgin drink and compensate with food instead! Would recommend grabbing a snack here if you‚Äôre passing by the market :)",5

Definitely one of the best food spots featured in Chelsea Market not only because of their quality food but also their top notch customer service. I ordered the Rib Eye Steak (in pita) which comes with a spicy green pepper and it was delicious! It was so good I wanted to order another despite being full. My significant other ordered the Steak and Egg (in pita) which also came with a spicy green pepper and a green onion (listed as a ‚Äúsnorkel‚Äù which my is fun and shows the light-hearted personality of the restaurant). The cocktails are excellent as well and there‚Äôs a great variety to choose from.

Every staff member we interacted with was knowledgeable and kind; specifically, there was a young staff member with long locs who was very attentive, checked on us, and cleared our table at just the right time. You are definitely getting your money‚Äôs worth here and I recommend that you dine in for the full experience!",5
57,Miznon,"435 W 15th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.5,M B,"The best Chicken Pita I have ever tasted.  The Folded Cheeseburger was pretty salty.

58,Miznon,"435 W 15th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.5,Rosa Silver,As close to Tel Aviv as I've found. Soft pita with meat drenched in sauce- string beans in lemon and garlic was good (a bit soft),4

61,Cull & Pistol,"75 9th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.6,Dave Rotes,"I was pretty happy with my experience dining here.  It is a nice little spot with limited seating, so better get there early.  For my appetizer, I had the tuna over crispy rice which was delicious.  I do not have much experience with crispy rice, but very much like the texture and taste.  The tuna was very good and was seasoned well making for a good starter.  I also had some of the oysters; not sure of the specific kind, but they did have bread crumbs and scallions with a little hint of cheese.  These were great and I was slightly sad when we finished them which is a good thing.  For my main course, I had the lobster roll with fries.  The lobster was very tasty and the fries were nice and crispy as you can probably see in the picture.  My father ordered the scallops and let me have a try; they were some of the best scallops I have had in a while.  I don't really have anything too negative to say about this place; my only gripe would be I wish the lobster roll was a little bit bigger.  When ordering it, I thought of other lobster rolls I had in the past that came huge, and fully loaded with meat falling out.

We were a party of 7 and they made the effort to accommodate us, in spite of the place being full. Service was great. Food delicious.

My daughter and my grandbaby had been to this location, and they wanted me to experience what they had. Fresh, fresh seafood. We had oyster at the lobster place next door first before wanting to eat a main entr√©e. The food was good. The location was clean. Will definitely return.",5
64,Cull & Pistol,"75 9th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.6,Jean Philippe Guy,"This restaurant had been on my list for a while. Went in for lunch on a recent visit to NYC. We arrived on time for our reservation. Host was very pleasant and we were seated promptly in this fairly small restaurant. Among several great menu offerings, were a selection from their cold bar that we don't get in the southern states- we opted for a combination of fresh selection of oysters and clams, and their mixture of fried calamaries, shrimp & fish to get started. For main courses I went with their lobster roll Connecticut style, and the rest of my party ordered steamed mussels, grilled octopus, and grilled shrimp. Our oysters/clams arrived and after a while it was obvious that our fried calamaries/shrimp had been forgotten. We mentioned it to the waitress and she said they were on their way out. We did get them 5mns later- they were very tasty and worth the wait. Fresh shucked oysters and clams were extremely fresh and just incredible. My lobster roll was made out of lobster claws and knuckles - I've had better $35 lobster rolls. Meat was kind of rubbery. Fries that came with it were nicely seasoned. Steamed mussels were very fresh but slightly overcooked and also rubbery - broth that came with it was nicely seasoned. Apparently both the octopus and shrimp were a hit as I didn't get to taste them. Overall a really great restaurant with lots of very fresh seafood. Although our waitress had obviously forgotten one of our appetizer, she was extremely nice and professional. We did get a couple of miss but I would gladly give them another try.",4
65,Cull & Pistol,"75 9th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.6,Anna Gorovits,"Incredible from start to finish. My boyfriend and I made dinner reservations here tonight. The menu looks amazing as well and we will be sure to come back and try the many other appetizing options. We started with the Double Down oyster platter. That includes 2 of each of the fresh oysters on the menu. They were delicious, super fresh and meaty. We also got the raw yuzu diver scallop and it was phenomenal! For the main appetizer we got the Pistols on Horseback which were the fried oysters and those melted in your mouth along with the rich flavors of the ham and spices. For the main dish I got the scallops which were perfectly tender and plump. My boyfriend got the mussels which were equally outstanding.  We dipped the grilled bread into the broth. YUM!!!! Everything was washed down with a spicy MargarIta and a nice crisp IPA. Our server Edward was attentive and friendly as well. Wonderful experience from start to finish. We will be back 100%!",5

We ordered four tapas and four glasses of wine for around $200 with tax and tip. The food was good but it was relatively small portions even by tapa standards. I ordered  the Camarones Al Ajillo in fresh garlic cloves and white wine and crab legs.  The shrimp and crab legs were roughly four pieces each and around $15 each plate. The sauce was delicious especially when sopped up with bread.  Nika got Churrasquito which was okay and a cheese platter which was sparse for $22. When we went they had a live band playing but they were playing in the corner [almost like alcove] instead of the middle of the room and we couldn't really see or hear them very well. Our waiter was okay, after ordering we rarely saw her again. Even after spending $200 on our meal we were still hungry that we went to McDs [yes, not the best thing to do after eating a nice meal] to get McNuggets and fries.

I was greeted up front by a woman and she was very friendly. I ordered  Pan-fried noodles with Chicken, pan-fried pork, shrimp, & chive dumplings, and a ginger lemonade.

I‚Äôm so happy I went here. The food was amazing! I ate the noodles for lunch and when it was reheated, the same smell from the night before came back. My brother was even asking me where I got it from. The portion of both was great. The chicken wasn‚Äôt too crispy and the noodles weren‚Äôt soggy. I shared the dumplings with my brother and we both agreed that the dumplings were some of the best we had in a while. The ginger lemonade was pretty good, the ginger was a little too much for me.

After we chomped our halfs down, he looked at me and asked if we had time to order one more, but the food area had already closed and the owner was kind enough to make the last sandwich for us whole everything was closing.

There was a wait but it wasn't ridiculously long. The cashier at the front kept checking in on me.

When I got my food, everything looked good! I took a couple of bites of the ribs and was astounded. The flavors were there! The rice was decent, but the ribs really took me AWAY!

I took a couple of sips of the froze and it was okay. It was tasty, but I felt like it was very sweet.

I got home and ate some and had to save the rest for the next day because I didn't want it to finish!

I shared the tacos with my brother and we both decided they were pretty decent as well. We both rated it a 7/10.

The chocolate budino was rich and silky, perfect for chocolate lovers to share. The price is definitely west village level but for the experience it‚Äôs worth the value for a cozy get together.",5

However, the only downside was that people were in a hurry, making the dinner feel rushed. After the entre, the waiter took the plates, and we still needed to finish. We had made a reservation for 9 PM, but I wonder why they take reservations at nine if they make you feel like you need to rush through your meal. Despite this, I highly recommend this restaurant because of the exquisite food and lovely atmosphere.",5
131,Barbuto,"113 Horatio St, New York, NY 10014, USA",4.3,Andi W,Underwhelming entrees. Hanger steak in chunks? And not cooked as ordered. Gnocchi overdone and flavor was masked by flavoring. Kale salad excellent and coconut cake divine. Manager could have cared less if we were pleased. Oh well. Not up to the hype.,3

Well we may as well have stayed in midtown because this place was a waste of time and money. The food tasted like nothing, including the gnocchi which was labeled as a ""signature dish"". The service was good, but nothing more than what I would expect for a restaurant of this price point. They ran out of the special, off menu side item and they gave us another option on the house. We got the potatoes which didn't go off the theme of tasting like nothing. The atmosphere is fine. I would not recommend and I wouldn't go back.",2

Damn, this place is popular! We ordered two pizza slices, the classic pepperoni, and the must-try house special artichoke. The all-vegetarian artichoke slice was oozing with cream cheese and it was a bit too much for my friend but I seriously loved it! And the pepperoni slice was the perfect meat-to-cheese ratio. The slices were cut in two for convenience, well thought! At almost ~$10 for a slice, the place is a bit expensive but worth it!",4

We tried their Banana Hot Cakes, Chicken Karaage, Japanese Curry Shakshuka and Wagyu Steak with fried eggs & a side of fries to share with a group of four. Everything was delicious especially the hot cake, which is puffy, soft and perfect with the homemade miso ice cream. The only complaint is the portion of ice cream was super small and was off-balanced with the huge hot cake.",4

I enjoy the black cod dish the most. I also like the beef covered by chocolate. Mushroom broth with mint jelly one is fun. The scallop with back caviar does not taste as good as I like. Scallop is not as tender. Black caviar is bitter to me. Personally I seldom eat pasta and the only pasta I like is truffle pasta with Parmesan. Is fun to experience it.
Service is good. Very kind.",4

Every pasta tasted uneventful but was plated nice. All the seafood tasted like it was left out for 3 days. I wouldn‚Äôt use any of that seafood as bait. Some of it made us gag. We played nice, and pretended to enjoy it. The total bill was $350, and we didn‚Äôt buy any alcohol drinks. The best thing we ate was the small piece of bread to dip in olive oil.
Should have complained when we were there, but we figured we got a hooked by a tourist trap and learned a lesson. I can‚Äôt believe they served that stuff to people. Waiter was nice though.",1

The onions were sweet, the chicken actually tasted like chicken (Chipotle‚Äôs chicken just tastes like grill marks), and oh, the vinaigrette. I loved the vinaigrette: punchy, almost fruity, well-seasoned. However, everything just didn‚Äôt come together as a salad. The chips were awkwardly large and flavorless, the chunks of tomato were also unwieldy and mostly watery, and there just wasn‚Äôt enough dressing or salt to hold up to all the water gushing out from the lettuce. For $13, I didn‚Äôt regret getting the salad, but I don‚Äôt think I would get it again. If you‚Äôre looking for a bit of a punch and lots of lettuce, though, you might not mind this dish.",3

Ok: cookies and cream, strawberry

It's kind of cool they let you mix flavors. The milkshake is thick and creamy but creamy reminiscent in the way that milk tea from powder is creamy, not my jam in terms of texture. I thought they would make it with flavored ice cream but I think it might be syrups/flavoring + soft serve?

With the price being so high, I expected a lot better from this place but the pizza ended up being extremely mid, one of our pizzas was even cold which was pretty shocking as we had to wait a while for the food (again, I initially brushed this off as it was a busy place but the food should've at least been warm).

I ordered a set of 5 jian bao (fried bottom dumplings) for $10. They had 5 different kinds so I ordered one of each (pork, beef, chicken, lamb, and impossible meat).

The first one I had was the pink pork one and it was tasty. I got them to-go to eat in a park so I didn‚Äôt expect them to be fresh and crispy, but even then the skin was a bit cold and the bottom wasn‚Äôt very crispy to begin with. The skin was also a bit on the thick and chewy side for my taste.

After that each dumpling that I had continued to be less appetizing. In terms of flavor the pork one was definitely the best. I had my hopes up after the first bite but was quickly disappointed.",2

Tables aren‚Äôt super clean if people leave it messy. We ordered Chole Kulcha (liked it, should try), Veg Momos are yummy (must try if you are a vegetarian) and the FAMOUS Vada Pav (again a must try dish, my wife is a big fan of Mumbai‚Äôs Vada Pav and you get that taste here with special Red masala) and Masala Chai (original Indian chai taste).",4

To my surprise food was really good. We ordered the chicken momos which are a must try. Only gripe was the food took long which wore our patience thin but was worth the wait as the food was good. Has plenty of vegetarian options as well for those who don‚Äôt consume meat. Would go again.",5

They have a lot of variety, and really like their idea of selling some popular snacks, masalas and Rooh Afza!  And, the kulfi was presented so nicely!  Liked the touch of rooh afza on it!",5

We had few appetizers and main courses and they did not miss! My favorite was the salmon with baked potatoes and beef skewers. The desserts were also 10/10!

I love the Balearic sunset cocktail and the food was amazing, I highly recommend the eggplant, one of the best things I tried this year so far. Also, the ambient is really nice, with live music on the background but not too loud, so you can still enjoy the conversation with your friends. Will be back for sure.",5

that is perfectly fine; I heard peak hours are bad.

But the noodles were so good! Every chew had some pull to them and the thickness was not heterogeneous, some little spittle of hot oil and cumin, a helping of cilantro and onions, all to form a perfect, aromatic bite.

You get to watch the chef slap it against the counter as you hear the onomatopoeic (this is probably not a word but should be) „ÄåÂ®òÂ®ò ÔºÅ„Äçagainst the countertop.

Get the hibiscus tea as well; it‚Äôs an arranged marriage of the sweetness with the savoury fragrant kick of the noodles.",4

Taiwan Beef Soup Noodle. Regular is mild lol. I‚Äôll am strong and will get spicy, esp for the weather.

Not very Taiwanese, it uses mostly beef slices instead of brisket chunks; Xi‚Äôan style noodle rather than thinner Taiwanese ones; spiced rather than tomatoey‚Äî overall northwestern Chinese, which I do adore. (Yes to thick wide springy noodles!)

Good portion with bountiful beef. Love the tendon parts.

Food came super fast. The diverse kitchen is lovely.",5
199,Very Fresh Noodles,"409 W 15th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.6,Vincent Cheung,"Everything I‚Äôve ordered has hit all the right notes but my most recent visit revealed my must try dish. The hand pulled noodles are the primary draw of the shop and their taste stands up to the excellent show of talent from the noodle makers. Even then my must order dish is the chicken wings. THESE ARE THE MOST FLAVORFUL WINGS I‚ÄôVE EVER HAD. There were so many layers of flavor combined with the ideal crunchy exterior and juicy interior. I instinctively took my time to savor each bite of the chicken and crispy toppings. It‚Äôs no exaggeration when I say, I daydream about going back and getting another order.",5
200,Very Fresh Noodles,"409 W 15th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.6,Carlos Grotewold,"Out of this world. A place like this deserves a Michelin star or a Bib Gourmand.

The salmon belly special was great, I'd recommend it if it's available when you eat here.

I found the Toro pieces to be a bit large. Weird complaint I know..",5

204,Lobster Place,"75 9th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.5,Nalin Dadarwala,So this place is a restaurant and a seafood market all in one. Honestly how much more fresh can seafood get when it's going from the market which is behind you to the counter which is in front of you. My friends and I had the oysters which they had a fantastic selection which they also displayed by size and salinity of the oyster on a chart so that you could make a decision based upon what you liked instead of trying to pick blindly. We also had the sushi which was fantastic. I ended up getting a specialty role that was made with tuna and had seared Toro on top. This place is fantastic for anybody that's looking for a really good experience with seafood while not getting ripped off on the price.,5
205,Lobster Place,"75 9th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.5,Katherine Larrequi,"It was alot of people there.  They have Individuals who go around picking up the menu checklist of what you selected. You have to pay before you get your order. First come, first serve type of place. Scope out for chairs to sit. I had the oysters samplers. Delicious",5
206,Lobster Place,"75 9th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.5,Jess Smith,"This place used to be amazing! Delicious lobster rolls where you could really taste the freshness of the lobster... Then they added sushi and an oyster bar... Probably it is good to offer several seafood options , but as its name suggests, this is the lobster place... And nowadays.... Ok lobster... Too much celery and shallots that you can no longer taste the lobster... And mayo... For me it takes away the simple deliciousness of the lobster... I think I will stick with Luke's from now on... Gave four stars for the cleanliness, options for tourists and decent prices for Manhattan... For a lobster lover like me, it is more like three stars.... disappointing...",4

We were ignored and rushed. We still stayed around because we tried to stay in good spirits. Our first waiter rushed us to to close out and informed us that another person would take care of us. After some time, with no service, we decided to speak with the manager on duty to give some feedback. We understand that staff maybe busy however we deserve to at least to be checked on. Especially on my friends special day. Donnie, the manager was SO amazing. He offered his sinceres apology and took care of us. Our experience was delightful at the end.  We appreciated it so much! We will be back!",4

The food was alright and good enough to fill up an empty stomach. The service wasn't great. It toke a while to get our order taken and for our food to arrive. The burger, the fish tacos and grilled cheese were okay. But the avocado toast was just very bland.",3

213,Shake Shack Meatpacking District,"820 Washington St, New York, NY 10014, USA",4.2,Dwayne Noel,"Today was my first time going to this Shake Shack location since it‚Äôs right next to my job. I went on my break, which was only 30 minutes to grab a quick meal. I ordered a Smoke Shack burger with cheese fries, and a bottle of water. I waited for my meal which didn‚Äôt take too long only to notice that my fries didn‚Äôt come with cheese. So I asked who I can assume is the manager if they could get me some cheese because I ordered that. They looked at my receipt and said that I didn‚Äôt order cheese. So I asked them if they could give me a cup on the side. They go to the back to give me a cup of cheese. I honestly just assumed that they were going to give it to me, but brought it to the register and made one of the employees ring me up for a dollar cup of cheese, which should‚Äôve already been on my meal because that‚Äôs what I asked for. I‚Äôm not gonna lie. I was pretty annoyed that they went out of their way to ring me up for a dollar cup of cheese that he could‚Äôve just given me for the inconvenience. Instead of looking at me like I was lying for a cup of cheese. I take my cheese and I rush back to work to eat my lunch only to see that I had a regular cheeseburger and not the Smoke Shack burger. I‚Äôm not gonna lie I was pissed. Not only did I pay over $15 for a meal but I paid that amount of money for my order to be wrong and my break was over so I had no time to do an exchange and just had to eat it. If I‚Äôm going to pay almost $10 for a burger, I expect my order to be correct and just from this one incident alone of how things were handled I definitely will not be going to this location ever again.",1

The food was incredible, the servers were kind and helpful, and the vibe was perfect. The escargot was out of this world and the lobster bisque was rich and creamy. The lobster risotto special was delicious and the duck was rich and savory. Our server and the man who asked to take our dishes were both extremely friendly and made us feel welcome on our first visit. They even made sure to bring out a dessert for my husband‚Äôs birthday when we had to rush out Thank you Pastis, what a special place! üòä We will definitely be back!",5
218,Pastis,"52 Gansevoort St, New York, NY 10014, USA",4.5,Pain,"Great experience! It was absolutely packed on a Saturday night. We were lucky to have been able to walk in and ask for a table of 5, with only a 10 minute wait. We sat outside but the tables are heated from above a little bit. We couldn‚Äôt really feel the heat though lol. The food was tasty, the escargots were a little overseasoned with garlic. I liked the Chicken Kiev a lot and my friends liked the other dishes as well. I would go back for sure and try the other items on the menu. The dessert was great too. Loved the creme brulee and the other pic I attached (forgot the name). We each paid probably between $40-$60 after tax and tip.",5
219,Pastis,"52 Gansevoort St, New York, NY 10014, USA",4.5,Shaya Klechevsky,"My first time back after the reopening at the current location. I'm pleasantly relieved to report that the zeitgeist of the original has been maintained. We had the delicious escargot served in little deep pockets of garlic butter with crispy baguette slices, as well as the crispy artichoke, a perfectly executed Jewish Roman dish - Carcioffi alla Giudia. While the menu description said garlic aioli, it was actually just a (deliciously) flavored smooth mayonnaise and lacked the bite I've come to expect from a true aioli. We also ordered the croque madame, which was perfection on the plate, with a side of deliciously crisp and evenly dressed gem lettuce, as well as the Quiche Florentine which looks like it was baked in a deep dish pizza pan or spring form. Truly a magnificent height and was equally flavorful. Of course, brunch would not have been complete without their impeccably balanced Bloody Mary (I take mine with Hendricks). The experience really brought me back to the original location, and the nostalgia alone was worth it. Highly recommend an excellent, quintessential, NYC brunch experience.",5

The table-side preparation of the Cacio Pepe was not only delicious but also added an extra layer of excitement to the meal.

The food ‚Ä¶ the truffle pasta is now officially my favorite dish in NYC, the Sancerre was on point and the Negronis my husband drank were delish.
We booked the chefs counter seats and when we arrrive we asked if we could change seats they informed us the restaurant was full but right after the entree the host came to us saying a table was now free if we wanted to change. We were so comfortable at this point that we ended up staying  but just another example on how attentive they are. Also we had dinner at the cucina but the room next door was stunning.
If you want a dinner in a cool environment delicious food and outstanding service this place is for you.
Price around 200-300$ (incl. tip) for 2 people if pasta, alchool and desserts but can go higher for more expensive dishes or lower for less food.
Will certainly come back",5

The wine selection is huge.    Bread and pasta is their strong suit.  We tried the focaccia formaggio, fettuccine and agnolotti. Service was okay, and I'm taking one star off.   They are a little all over the place, and it was hard to hear or understand them in this restaurant.  Overall we had a great experience here.",5

Food was delicious, service was polite and attentive and the atmosphere of this place is like no other in NYC.

We got the house made tiramisu that is a 100% must try.

237,AMMI,"25 11th Ave Kiosk 13, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.7,Shani Stanley,"I'm extremely disappointed.  I requested a Dosa, only to be told that he ran out of the mix and it'll take 20 mins to make more, which he clearly didn't want to spend his time doing. He didn't even offer the option of waiting and basically told me to order something else. This was on a Wednesday afternoon around 4, and it wasn't busy.

I then ordered two vegetable biryanis and one chicken curry. Not only did the biryani lack flavor (in my opinion), but it also lacked the yogurt that it's supposed to come with.  Clearly, he was trying to keep it for himself. Cheap smh. My brother had to request it, and even then, he only handed over one rather than two.

And the Partha was complete trash. It tasted like what I assume a mix of plastic and cardboard would taste like.

If you dont want to serve the people, please choose another field.",1

In the photos is my ‚Äúrice bowl‚Äù 90% spinach probably 5 bite sized pieces of chicken zero rice. The other photo shows the image they advertise it as.

However, I don‚Äôt except everyone to love their job. I too work in the neighborhood, so I completely get it. My salad was flipped all around but not in a ‚Äútossed salad‚Äù type of way, more like a I couldn‚Äôt care less type of way. Despite however, Luis viewed me as a guest or maybe just having a ho hum day. If he would simply adhere to the sweetgreen standard‚Ä¶all would be alright. We all work hard at earning our wages. Spending should be fun!",1

Often from the store at the Back Bay in Boston but also here in NYC. What excites me as one of the field is the concept. It is simply fresh and fast. Exactly what a customer wants. The quality is always excellent and the staff is courteous. From time to time I had the feeling that under pressure the hygiene measures have suffered something, but that is completely normal - when you work on such a high readiness. For those who eat meat, I recommend the plate with hot chicken. You will not regret it.",5

Ordered online for pickup but had to wait an extra 30 minutes. They have quite a few staff but order volume exceeds that. They need to prioritize store pickups over 3rd party delivery.

The bad part is that I SPENT $40.00 FOR TWO CHILD SIZE CHICKEN SANDWICHES. I was not pleased. The sandwich was very lackluster, void of any kind of condiments or special toppings to substantiate the $40 bucks. Oh, a side of Old Bay chips comes with the sandwich, but a pickle slice, and a squirt of mayo is it.

Very tasty and worth the try (despite of only offering pick up options).
We ordered:
- Bulgogi buns: Outstanding. Melted cheese was a key addition
- Kimchi Jigae Ramen: the broth was delicious and super creamy. Spicy, but not too spicy",5
250,m≈èkbar,"75 9th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.1,Pooja Gaikwad,Super tasty! We had a chicken katzu curry. Very well made with the right amount of spice. No wait time but this can fluctuate as the shop is within Chelsea market. There is no seating area. Standing only (they have a comfortable ledge to put food on). Worth every penny.

The biggest downside there's no seatings at the shop (even though they have the counters) so you'll have to look for a spot to sit down, which can be a hassle.",4

It's honestly one of the best things I have eaten. The porc is so tender it almost melts and mixes so, so well with the other flavors of the sandwich. The bread is soft and crusty almost to perfection and the onions bring just the right amount of sweetness.

They will ask you if you want some hot sauce with your sandwich. Yes. Take it. It takes an already very good sandwich to new heights.

We are on vacation here and I'm sad that I won't get to eat this again once I'm back home.",5

We are visiting here & my son wanted to try it for dinner. He tried a piece and said it tastes strange. My husband tried one & said it was gross. We went to the counter & asked them for our money back & they were rude & refused. They said it was our problem. Typically when you go to a restaurant, order something & aren‚Äôt happy with what your eating, you send it back & they take care of you. We were dumbfounded by their reaction to us- they were rude & uncaring. Definitely do not recommend this place- the service & food was a disappointment.",1

The place itself was pretty empty but the food was solid. They also have some prime real estate in Chelsea market and quite a bit of space to sit and enjoy your meal.

I opted for the beef kebab sandwich. The flavors were good but I would have liked it if the kebab was either cooked to order or just a bit warmer in general.

Overall a solid place and a good place to check out",4

Tourist areas that were extremely crowded and I‚Äôd had enough of the crowds.  I asked some locals ‚ÄúWhere do the locals go?‚Äù  Catch Steak was suggested to me so I made reservations, then decided to read the reviews.  After reading some of the reviews I almost cancelled my reservations bc a few said staff was rude and food wait was long.  I decided to go and form my own opinion.  My experience was quite different from the negative reviews.  When I walked in I was greeted with a warm welcoming. I arrived early for my reservations bc I wasn‚Äôt sure of traffic times.  I was asked if I‚Äôd like to check my coat in while I dined, which I thought was great!  since I was early I was offered a seat at the bar for a cocktail till my table was ready.  Although I was early and sat at the bar to have a cocktail, I didn‚Äôt have the time to finish it before my table was ready.  I was seated 15 min early.  The wait staff was really friendly, attentive and offered great suggestions.  My food came out in a timely manner,  was excellent and worth the price I paid and the experience I had.  The managers even came around checking on me  as well as other patrons in the restaurant.  I observed the staff working together helping each other out.  I was impressed to see management pouring water if the noticed a glass was getting low and making sure each table was taken care of.  One review said no photos could be taken, so I asked about that.   I dined alone and wanted a picture in there and the staff was happy to take my picture.  When I questioned about that the manager told me they  don‚Äôt allow flash photography.  Needless to say I was happy to have gone and form  my own opinion of Catch Steak!  It was a very pleasant experience.  I ordered the catch roll as an appetizer, truffle butter filet, crab and the Brussel sprouts.  I ordered an amaretto sour for my cocktail.  Outstanding food.",5

We ordered:
- Suranchae
- Shrimp Mandu
- Black Cod
- Japchae

Everything tasted delicious, we had to make some modifications to the entrees as my wife is pregnant, but the staff made it so easy for us. It was really nice sitting by the window to overlook Little Island, Pier 57 and the Highline. You feel like you‚Äôre in the center of where all the action is.

At the end of the night, the manager even gave us this super cute ‚ÄúGenesis House Food Critic‚Äù baby bib as a thank you gift for dining (how did they even have this ready for just us mentioning pregnancy for the menu!!?)

Definitely try it out and you‚Äôll be happy you did!",5
