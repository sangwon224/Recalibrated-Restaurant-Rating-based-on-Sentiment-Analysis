1,Malone's Irish Bar & Restaurant,"692 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.8,Amanda Morris,"This is a FABULOUS Irish bar! It's dark inside, authentic and just the place to feel at home especially for pond jumpers! Our server was down to earth, helpful and kept the drinks flowing for us! We had a late dinner here too but I forgot to take photos (sorry, we got into the city late after a long flight - I did manage to grab a photo of the outside the next day!) I had the chicken curry with fries and rice and it was very good. This place stays open until the early hours so it's the perfect spot to bed in and chill for the night with friends/family. Highly recommended for a chill vibe!",5
2,Malone's Irish Bar & Restaurant,"692 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.8,Kevin Joyce,"Malone's Irish Bar and Restaurant is your typical Irish Pub, which is a good thing.  In this day and age many are trying to mess with a tried and true formula in order to stand out, but Malone's stays true to Irish faire.  This is why you will find the patrons of this establishment have Irish and English accents, they feel at home.
The decor is traditional and inviting, a little tight near the bar area, but acceptable.  The wait staff is efficient and timely.  There is wide selection of beers and spirits.  I noticed they have some small distillery labels which I appreciate and the quality of most mainstream whiskies have declined over the years.
The food is ""A-"" to ""A"".  I had the corned beef and cabbage, which I know is an Irish-American dish, but it has come to be expected at any Irish pub, but rarely found for some reason unless it's around St.Patrick's day.  The boiled potatoes were great, the meat and cabbage both were tender.  I also had the sweet chilli wings and they were AWESOME.  My friend had the shepherd's pie and was thoroughly satisfied, took half home and told me how he enjoyed the leftovers even a few days later.

If you decide to go to Malone's you will not be disappointed.",4
3,Malone's Irish Bar & Restaurant,"692 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.8,EDWIN,"Great bar and restaurant. The staff is extremely helpful and very attentive to their customers. The food was delicious came out really quick. The burgers were real thick. The beers were cold. And the restaurant area is separate from the bar area so be okay to bring kids. Open dining area in the back with plenty of room. There's a couple of booths on the left hand side as you walk to the open dining area. They even outside sitting area as with the Irish doors on the wall.
The only complaint I have is that they don't have light beer on tap like Coors light for example. But they do have a variety of draft beers and a well stocked bar.
The owner is very Nice he came and chatted with us for about a good 20 minutes and we had a lot of laughs with him.",5
4,Malone's Irish Bar & Restaurant,"692 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.8,PhilYouIn,I have lots of experience with bars and this is an excellent one. They open at 7AM (!) and stay open until 4AM. The place has been around for years yet looks brand new. Super clean. Super friendly bartenders who know how to mix a cocktail and build a Guinness. We are at the bar and the food was cooked perfectly. It got very crowded with lots of happy people. The bathrooms are very clean as well. Reasonably priced. Fun place.,5
5,Malone's Irish Bar & Restaurant,"692 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.8,FLERIZA ARANZAZU,Stopped here on a Sunday night. Not too crowded and we enjoyed our time talking to the bartenders. Tim was very nice and friendly. We didn't get the other bartender's name but she is also nice and friendly.,5
6,Slice Pizza,"700 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.2,Amanda Morris,We visited here several times during our weekend in New York for a late night slice! The pizza is a solid 4/5 and they only took a few minutes to warm up a slice in the oven and you're on your way. $2 a slice (plain cheese) you can't go wrong!,5
7,Slice Pizza,"700 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.2,George Mais,This pizza is amazing.  The slices are crunchy but not hard. The sauce is perfect! This a walk in walk out place. You get your pizza and go.,5
8,Slice Pizza,"700 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.2,X ‚Äúhungrytommy‚Äù X,"The man behind the counter was friendly and polite, but the pizza wasn‚Äôt great. I got the meat lovers which only had two meats on it. It was pretty greasy which I generally don‚Äôt mind, but this was too much. There wasn‚Äôt enough sauce and I didn‚Äôt like the dough.

The space is really small with just a little counter to stand at if you don‚Äôt want to get it to go. You could never walk with this pizza. You would get grease all over you.

My son loved the cheese pizza, but then again his taste in pizza is questionable. Again, really nice people.",3

10,Slice Pizza,"700 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.2,Murad Assaf,"This is my local pizza spot, I prefer this over 99cent fresh around the corner. It‚Äôs a solid 4/5 and great for a late night bite on the way to or back home. My only complaint is that they tend to leave the pizza in the oven a bit too long sometimes, so I‚Äôve found that asking them to slightly heat it up makes all the difference.",4
11,The Perfect Pint,"203 E 45th St, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.3,Antony Lo,"Nice little Irish pub with good atmosphere and service.

I had a hankering for bangers and mash as well as Onion Rings.

The onion rings were amongst the best I‚Äôve ever had - light batter with the right amount of seasoning and the oil was fresh.

The bangers and mash were good too. Just the right amount of everything on the plate.

I‚Äôd say it is good value for money in a sit down restaurant in NYC.

Thank you!",5

Cute decor that gives medieval",4
14,The Perfect Pint,"203 E 45th St, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.3,Steven Zore,Had crab cakes appetizer perfect. Beef stew was 8/10 and tiramisu didn't have fresh whipped cream...but it was good to,4

Great place to have a drink with friends after the long week.

Ordered Guacamole dip, chared grilled Cheese Burger medium rare, and Rosie‚Äôs Cobb salad. My wife and I shared. It all tasted good. We requested some mustard and it was quite spicy (lucky me). Great food well prepared, prompt and friendly service, typical pub vibe.",5

19,Rosie Dunn's Victorian Pub,"729 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.6,Judy Han,"Love Rosie Dunn's! Service is quick and friendly, fantastic atmosphere, and it's just a beautiful bar. Will definitely be in my regular rotation going forward. The upstairs, especially, is so fun - great view from the wall of windows facing 3rd ave. It would be absolutely perfect for planning a group event there!  And perfect spot to meet up with friends!  Note: I hadn't realized that this is owned by Niall, of ""Niall's"" - the pub on 52nd street.  Makes sense now because I love that place too!  My husband works down the block and that's one of his favorites to grab a drink with his co-workers.  Same super-fun but not deafeningly loud atmosphere and always amazing service.",5

27,The LCL,"212 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017, USA",3.4,Mealifer Lew,"Atmosphere has a classy feel but it was too dark for me during lunch. Food was disappointing with the exception of my friends. My French Onion soup was too sweet n my burger didn't feel hearty. However, my friend Cobb salad was very good. Guess we got out of there for about $50 bucks.",3
28,The LCL,"212 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017, USA",3.4,Elizabeth Warren,"This place was an awesome atmosphere. The problem was with the waitress that we had helping us.
She was rude and nasty. I‚Äôve worked good service and get horrid Patton‚Äôs, but our family party was courteous, low maintenance and we said ‚Äúthank you‚Äù more than enough due to our waitresses obvious bad attitude.
When the check came, she tried to stiff us. Seriously, she tried to get us to pay more than we owed? After being called out, she said she was being ‚Äúvictimized‚Äù.
As a woman, I was livid that another woman would use this excuse when she was clearly in the wrong and trying to take advantage of us and the situation.
I am livid as a woman. The management should be shamed. This is not how we gain equality in this world. Never going back again and telling others with boyfriends and husbands to stay clear.",1
29,The LCL,"212 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017, USA",3.4,Danny Grocott,"Extremely overpriced, even for NYC. The staff don't seem too interested, and the quality isn't even that good.

Sure, the decor is nice, but not that nice it can charge as much as they do.

We had dinner the night of our stay at LCL bar and kitchen and the food was absolutely amazing!
The service was great, Stephanie (I believe shes a manager there) was so hospitable and did not fail to check on us once. She was very polite and provided us with impeccable service. We then had lunch the following day, and it was delightful. The guys who work in the kitchen i believe, were soooo great! They added ""I love you"" on my fiancee's dessert which ended our Valentine's day on a perfect note. I will definitely come back soon and 100% recommend this restaurant to anyone. Great food! Great service, overall great people, from the moment you enter, to the moment you leave. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE.",5

Finding that place to also be a respite from the hustle and bustle of life, that can be tricky! Especially on 42nd St!

Osteria Laguna checks all the boxes. Great food, great service, and the ambiance is far above anything you'd expect to find on 42nd St! We were able to eat and enjoy conversations with our friends effortlessly, despite being in a crowded restaurant near Grand Central Station.

Our party of 4 sampled a variety of dishes and desserts - each dish plated beautifully and presented in a timely manner. Desserts were delicious as well. The only downside was a lukewarm cappuccino served while awaiting dessert.",5

34,Osteria Laguna,"209 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.4,Michael Zmuda Trzebiatowski,"I never left any place without a tip.
That was my first time.
I was surprised at how fast they brought the food; it was really nice.
Also, the food that was served before our order, such as olives and bread  was better than my pizza, which I‚Äôve ordered.

Half of the pizza was burnt.
I didn‚Äôt eat that, as thin-dough Italian pizza, which is burnt, tastes awful.
None of the waiters care about it.
One guy took everything from our table, except the burnt pizza.
The guy who took our order and came with the bill completely ignored my complaint.
He was more interested in the tip than their service.
When I said that pizza was burnt, he said, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs fine, that‚Äôs fine.‚Äô

Nobody apologized; they didn‚Äôt care at all.
He didn‚Äôt even say goodbye when we said thank you.
Awful, poor service.
I will definitely never be back.",1
35,Osteria Laguna,"209 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.4,Jerica Bird,"Excellent service. Very attentive and prompt. Lovely atmosphere, they decorated it for the holidays which I appreciated. We got the mushroom risotto and the salmon ravioli. The risotto was just what I was looking for and the ravioli was such a fun treat‚Äîreally great flavor combination.

You need to remind to get thrn cleaned. Pizzas were delicious. We had the Juniors tiramisu which was quite dry. Didn‚Äôt quite enjoy it. The Juniors cheesecake was good. Although we would‚Äôve liked the crust to be of graham crackers rather than sponge.
Overall a good place to visit for quick pizza.",4
37,La Vera Pizzeria & Restaurant,"922 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.1,Tariq Shajahan,"I‚Äôm not sure if the pizza we had was just old or wasn‚Äôt made correctly or whatever other reason it may have been but the pizza here is mediocre. I tried to like it but it was just not very satisfying. The crust had no salt and tasted like cardboard and the sauce had no flavor. The only good part about this pizza was the cheese or rather the only thing I enjoyed anyways. I think they could definitely use more spices in all steps of their pizza making process. And again, I try to not eat too much salt but with this pizza I was practically begging for a little extra salt. Maybe it was just a bad batch/ we got there at the wrong time but 2 stars for the pizza itself. Everything else was fine (customer service was good  and tables were relatively clean but place itself could‚Äôve been maintained better)",3

40,La Vera Pizzeria & Restaurant,"922 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.1,Nu S,A great place to grab a slice and a drink for $5 on any day! I love sauce so I got the OG cheese slice. The pizza par cooked then finished when order so that it is hot and fresh. The dough is formed to a good NYC thin crust and they do have Sicilian crust options. They have both white and red pizza. I didn‚Äôt see cans of San Marzano tomatoes but the sauce was very good. The shop is air conditioned and spotless. The establishment had been given a Grade A rating when I visited. They take card with a $5 order. I‚Äôll be back to try other slice options.,5

54,Angeletto,"890 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.4,Philip Co,"My wife and I rarely eat out at Italian restaurants. She‚Äôs half Italian, so we save ourselves for family meals. We were in Manhattan with our daughter and had an early dinner reservation, but just after noon, my wife suddenly had a craving for mussels. A quick search for mussels in Turtle Bay took us to Angeletto.

Our intention was to eat light. However, the gracious reception by the host, the pleasant surroundings and the interesting menu made us order more than we had intended. Our waiter was terrific and the chef even came out of the kitchen to say, ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù

We ended up having the special of the day arugula salad, the mussels appetizer, which was a main in itself, black linguine with seafood, bucatini pasta and panna cotta. Everything was beautifully presented and delicious, and we cleared our plates.

In the end, we were glad that we had overindulged and are now questioning why we don‚Äôt eat out at Italian restaurants more often.",5

The amount of beef in the bowl was quite shocking, and it was juicy and plump, not dry and chewy.

Additionally, their dumplings are quite distinctive, with some dumplings wrapped inside a larger dumpling, showcasing a memorable culinary style. The taste of the dumplings resembles those from northern China, perhaps influenced by the ancient Silk Road trade between China and Georgia, resulting in similar flavors but with different cooking methods.

Furthermore, their salads are delicious, with healthy ingredients paired with appetizing sauces, making them perfect appetizers.

Lastly, the restaurant's service and ambiance are excellent, making it a great place to experience authentic Georgian cuisine.",5

The bread selection was versatile and good. To start, I had the roasted beet and goat cheese salad with crushed pistachios and citrus vinaigrette along with the creamed spinach, shrimp cocktail and seared tenderloin with butter poached lobster tails. My mom had the lobster mac n cheese. I really enjoyed the salad, shrimp cocktail and surf n turf combo. The lobster mac n cheese was okay, but I will say that there are other places that can cook this a little better though. My take on it is that it was a little dry and needed more seasoning. All in all, good food and great service. I hope they reopen the one in FiDi so I can eat there again soon.",5

We‚Äôd like to thank Capital Grill for making our anniversary truly special, and one in which we‚Äôll forever cherish.

We were warmly welcomed by the restaurant‚Äôs staff and were quickly provided with a very comfortable table. Throughout the evening, the staff graciously acknowledged and wished us a wonderful anniversary and thanked us for celebrating the occasion at Capital Grille.

Our server, Corey O treated us with impeccable hospitality and made us feel very welcomed and right at home!!! He was kind, incredibly courteous, superbly addressed all of our inquiries and offered great insight and suggestions on the menu options.

In addition to the great service, both my wife and I were impressed with Capital Grille‚Äôs elegant settings, especially the dark wood paneled interior, the tall glass windows, and the gorgeous art portraits spread throughout the restaurant. The playing of jazz music and classic hits sung by Billie Holiday & Louis Armstrong were also a great treat and enriched our romantic evening!!!

Last, but certainly not least, my wife and I absolutely loved our meals. Everything from the appetizers to the entrees to our dessert was perfectly delicious!!! On a scale of 1 to 10, I would grade our meals a score of ‚Äú Infinity & Beyond.‚Äù

My wife ordered and enjoyed her lamb chop based entree & her spinach side dish, while I ordered and loved my pan seared salmon based entree & my mash potato side dish. Our meals were superbly seasoned, tasty and wonderfully cooked. Our dessert, the Classic Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e was simply off the charts and unquestionably delicious!!!

When I got to the store around 6pm my order was not ready even though the store was empty and other people entered and picked up their meal at the counter for in-person orders when I was still waiting for mine.

The real shock was when I received my orders which were half way empty. This is my very first time ordering cava online and it will be the last. This never happens when I put my orders in person. I asked the employees behind the counter why my bowls were half way empty while the bowls they prepare for in person orders right there in front of me had way more. Btw I picked from their bowl options - nothing special here. They told me that online orders are prepared in the back and they put less than in person orders and they gave me example ‚Äúthat‚Äôs how at McDonald‚Äôs too‚Äù. Huh? This does not make sense at all. They told me they can add more to my bowls but I didn‚Äôt have time to wait anymore and left.

Dear Cava management, given the company just went public, how do you think not standardizing your online and in person services is okay? In New York, especially, people have many options and client satisfaction is an important factor to consider.",2

124,Blue Park Kitchen,"666 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.1,Ellen,Food was good and the portion size was decent. The interior of the cafe is bright and cozy. I created my own bowl and everything tasted good. They made a minor mistake on my order but rectified it when I informed them so check your food before! Also I think Google maps doesn't have the correct location to the restaurant so I had a little bit of trouble finding it. It's next to CHOPT.,5
125,Blue Park Kitchen,"666 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.1,Pete wendeborn,"If this place was anywhere other than NYC, it would be a nice find and I'd recommend it, but they are in mid-town Manhattan, the bar is much higher. The food must be completely fresh, which this was not, the customer service must be helpful and informative which they were not, the interior must be clean and interesting, which this was not. Mediterranean/ middle eastern food is a trending culinary food of choice. These new fast casual places are a dime a dozen. You need to be better to make any impact, especially if you are new. Food hoices were very interesting, but the quality was moderate at best.",3

Steamed chicken and roasted chicken were both good surprisingly, although the portion was slightly small. Both juicy and flavorful. They didn‚Äôt even need sauces tbh.

I also got a side mushroom which was good but a little bit too salty. Better have it with rice.",4

Food was good here! The ginger rice and the dressing are stellar! So good! Next time I think I‚Äôll try the roasted chicken! The steamed chicken and rice needed some more seasoning and they don‚Äôt have the soy dipping sauce (which is okay). Just not a home run. Decent meal for the price, with limited seating; more like an order and go situation. If the que gets long it gets very crowded very fast. But service was pretty friendly and nice. I‚Äôd def go back cause the flavors were good. Just wish I also got a little more for the $13+ dollars.",4

The Thai fried rice was however great. The quantity was large, you really need to be hungry to eat all.

141,Bento Sushi,"685 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",3.8,Deb Lin,The prices are on par with what you might find in a grocery store; but the quality is lower than what you'd find at Whole Foods or even Fairway.

The employees acted terrible, so slow. I asked for several items that I did not receive. The steak was cooked horribly wrong. The French onion soup was full of salt.

Whenever I spoke to the general manager he laughed in my face, and said it was impossible that my food was not made correctly because he owns a very successful restaurant. He tried to charge me for a glass of water, I said that‚Äôs fine but I‚Äôll simply dispute it on my credit card. He waded up the receipt and told me to leave, very loudly.

The sashimi was melt-in-your-mouth perfection, each bite a testament to the quality of the fish. From the vibrant tuna to the buttery salmon, every piece was a taste of the ocean's bounty.

Personally, I find their grilled skewers very tasty, and the toppings on the soba are also quite good. However, the cold soba tends to be a bit dry and soft, not the best in New York City in my opinion. I've been more impressed by the soba at other places like Uzuki and Sobaya, which also specialize in soba. But this is just my experience, as others may have different experiences.

Additionally, their sashimi is very fresh, and the menu offers a variety of options, making it suitable for a quick lunch or a gathering with friends after work during the week.",4

The takoyaki was good though!",2

The ambiance is a harmonious blend of modern sophistication and traditional charm, creating an inviting space for gastronomic exploration. It's not just a restaurant; it's a culinary haven where soba is elevated to an art form.

Great atmosphere with a focus on Japanese authentic food and a wide variety of sake. Most of the dishes we ordered were delicious but the calamari was dry.

No signs, no way of knowing it‚Äôs there if you haven‚Äôt been tipped off, the most elaborate sake menu I‚Äôve seen since being in Tokyo and food that taste just like it did in Japan.

The ambiance of the place is lovely too‚Äî as is the transition from the heavily lit lobby of the apartment building down a flight of stairs that is half way between NYC and Tokyo to a full immersion into Tokyo, complete with cherry blossoms.

Everything on the menu looked great and given the location, right next to the UN, the prizes are reasonable. We had the udon noodles, edamame beans, and a rice soup bowl. To top it all off we shared the sesame cheesecake with matcha, which was as good as it sounds.

I can‚Äôt wait to go back and try all the other items on the menu and surprise people, as I feel Sakagura invented a travel portal that links Japan to the US‚Äîand kept it a secret for a select few.",5

Some of our favorites were the Kawari Tofu (shirasu were perfect and crunchy), Sake-kasu salmon (umami bomb in my mouth), and the onigiris!  Be careful with the Uni Ikura Mozuku.  The Mozuku seaweed is pretty long and difficult to eat because it isn't easy to cut it with your teeth.  Maybe it's just me, but this was way too big to handle in one bite, so that is what made it slightly difficult to manage.  Otherwise, the atmosphere, food, and service all get top marks!",5

We did the premium course because my friends and I had two big occasions to celebrate so we wanted to go all out. The courses did NOT disappoint in the least. Everything we had was top quality, fresh, beautifully arranged.

The restaurant was also really cool. Very nice d√©cor, cool tables where you take your shoes off and get an intimate corner for you and your group. It all felt like quite the experience.

Here's the rub - the service was bad. One of my friends had to ask for water no less than 5 times. We were very rarely checked on. The waiter asked if we wanted to cook the meat or if we wanted him to. We asked if he could, and he walked away and never came back. That was a big disappointment.

Regardless, I would definitely come back. The food was incredible and service be damned.",4

214,Yakiniku TORAJI,"217 E 43rd St Fl 1, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.3,Patrick Wong,"TLDR: If you want great yakiniku - Toraji is a solid spot. The original chain is from Ebisu in Tokyo and is still there so you know it's authentic. While you can do the course menus, I find the a la carte is tasty, high quality and not that crazy. Get the signature steak selection, the negi rice and the yukaejang.

A chef friend recommended this place many many times but we only recently finally gave it a try. Wow - love it. It's a small spot but you instantly feel like you're back in Tokyo (or if you've never been, this is what a Tokyo resto feels like) sitting down for yakiniku.

We splurged on some of the apps the first time. Yukhoe (I can skip personally), wagyu sushi (do not skip). The kimchi platter is good to eat between bites but I prefer the Toraji salad. The negi rice, it's so simple but that egg yolk with all them scallion whites. BOMB.

OK, onto the meat. Skirt steak was lovely, nice and beefy, well marbled. The Toraji signature steak selection is great if you want to try the greatest hits. The thick beef tongue (do not miss this please), the filet, wagyu loin, a little bit of everything. It's simple but the cuts are very high quality. We did the yukaejang with the ramen noodles but I think I prefer the soup on its own.

Easily one of my favorite places to eat beef going forward. So good we went again a month or two later. They also just opened a location downtown near Chinatown on Bowery if Midtown is too far.",5

Seems really understaffed and some of the meat they cooked for us just ended up getting burnt. Also waited for something like 20mins for our dessert (turned out delicious tho).

The longer version: For some reason Thai-Nam restaurant decided to open a sub-restaurant inside of itself that features Japanese food.  I'm not exactly sure why, but there's a bright yellow awning outside that says ""Chef's Secret"" and menus and everything.

However, their food is pretty typical of the food that Thai-Nam has, in that it's fairly awful.  I had the chicken teriyaki lunch special.  It came with three shumei dumplings, three pieces of a California roll, salad and rice.

None of it was good.

The chicken had been frozen, and the texture was awful.  The shumei were greasy, the sushi was also pre-made.  The standard Japanese salad dressing was similarly bad.  The only thing that made this even vaguely worthwhile was that you do get a lot of food for ten bucks.  But it's really bad food.

You can do better.",2

If you like this kinda thing, there‚Äôs a piano player who sings lounge music (loudly). I asked to be seated as far away as possible.

We received a $25 coupon code (if you spend $75 or more before tax & tip) from visiting the Field of Light nearby. We were hungry so we gave it a shot. I had a $15 cocktail that was pretty good. We both got burgers, around $26 each. Mine was one of the worst burgers I ever had. I asked for medium rare and I got well done. Why even ask? Fries were ok. We shared a wedge salad to start.

Their red wine was a Cabernet Sauvignon from Spain which wasn't my favorite. I tried their United Nations cocktail which was very strong in the lemon flavor over elderflower so I didn't like it either.

243,DF Nigerian Food Truck,"828 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.1,Kenny,"I‚Äôve been patronizing this food truck for years, and I wanted to be sure I liked their dishes before making a decision, and I‚Äôm glad to say this food truck has really improved over the year, based on my consistent orders.

I have tried most of the dishes they serve, my favorites are the Ilasepo, the honey beans with corn and dodo
( heaven in a plate) the spicy snails, which has just the right amount of spice (nothing over the top) and the goat meat peppersoup which is the perfect hangover remedy or even the perfect acquaintance for a cold day. The meat is so tender.

The potions are good and they‚Äôre always well packaged, to avoid spills. I would be mad if that happened because I do not play with my Naija food. Every now and then they also send a freebie to thank me for my consistent patronage, which I truly appreciate.
When I feel homesick, (which is a lot of times these days), DF Nigerian food truck really helps me cure that. Definitely my go-to for authentic Nigerian meals.

I hope they stay as consistent, and if that truly is the case, God help my pocket",5
244,DF Nigerian Food Truck,"828 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.1,Abiola Marisol,"One of the best Nigerian restaurants I have been to, I live in Rhode Island when I‚Äôm craving Nigerian dishes I will drive out to Nyc wish they open a spot out here , I usually don‚Äôt kno what to order so I will get couple of different selections everything is great on the Menu‚Ä¶. Definitely worth the drive , I would recommend every one who has not tried Nigerian food that lives in the New York area to definitely give it a try you will not be disappointed!!!!",5
245,DF Nigerian Food Truck,"828 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.1,JY ASH,"I bought different items from the food truck in front of the Nigerian embassy a few days ago around 2 pm. They were already out of fried plantain so early in the day for a food service that is open until 7 pm or later.
I bought goat meat stew, Jollof rice, efo riro and agege bread. Only the goat meat stew was tolerable. Everything else was horrible. The efo riro was not fully cooked. The vegetables (spinach) was crunchy to the bite. It was plain without ‚Äòemi‚Äô in it, boring and tasteless.
Next Jollof rice omg! on a scale of 1-10, it was 0/10. Tasteless, flavorless overcooked rice. Horrible to say the least. The worst of it all was the agege bread. They offer full loaf or half loaf. I ordered full loaf but I was given half loaf without any explanation. I was not aware of the switch until I got home. As if that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, please be aware, they keep most of their food in the freezer including bread so they are not freshly made. The frozen bread was defrosted in the microwave. Can anyone believe it? Well this is not a joke because it happened to me. By the time I got home, the bread was as hard as stone.
I paid over $60 that day and gave a big tip and got food that was inedible except the goat meat which I ended up eating by itself. The rest went in the trash. I can‚Äôt believe this truck is still open. How is it possible? The worst Nigerian food I ever bought.",1

I returned today craving same sandwich and experience.  There was only 1 worker doing both the register and cooking.  Tofu was stale, and only 3 cube pieces per sandwich half, bread was extra hard and toasted.  They also charged me 11.50 + tax for this terrible sandwich.  Worker seemed overwhelmed, didn't smile and restaurant needed cleaning up.  Completely opposite experience from my first visit.  What a shame.",1
249,Mama Pho,"900 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10017, USA",3.7,Bruno Storchi Bergmann,"It's actually better than the average of reviews might suggest. The pho is pretty decent and tasty with some characteristics I had never found before: the bean sprouts were already cooked (which I enjoyed much more) and the meat is generous (I had pieces of meat until the end of my pho). What I didn't enjoy was the ambience: looks like a fast food place with poor decor and no originality. I don't agree with the notion of having pho as a fast food. Also, their boba tea is mediocre at best.",4

The beef broth is insane - so flavorful and well seasoned - and the ingredients were all perfect from the fresh bean sprouts to the mint & cilantro.

My one piece of criticism would be that the fried tofu tasted a bit fishy, and the vegetable spring rolls were a bit overdone, but the pho was so good that I don't care.",5

The atmosphere was amazing and delicious food with outstanding drinks.

260,Barnea Bistro,"211 E 46th St, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.7,Rabbi Yisroel Bernath,"Embarking upon the gastronomic journey that is Barnea in the heart of Manhattan, one finds themselves in a culinary dreamscape, where each dish serves as a verse in an epicurean sonnet. This establishment isn't just a restaurant; it's a symphony of flavors conducted by the maestro chefs, with the bustling, yet impeccably orchestrated, service reminiscent of a New York minute‚Äîswift, efficient, and without a beat missed.

Our odyssey commenced with a parade of appetizers that whispered tales of the sea, the earth, and the ethereal realms in between. The king salmon crudo, a dish that seemingly swam from the ocean depths directly to our plates, offered a refreshing prelude with its delicate texture and zesty accompaniments. The Barnea egg Benedict, a celestial reimagining of a brunch classic, was poached not just in water, but in a potion of culinary magic, making each bite a revelation.

The polenta fries were like golden beams of sunshine on a plate‚Äîcrispy on the outside, whisper-soft within, proving that even the humblest ingredients can be elevated to haute cuisine. Crispy dumplings, a playful nod to the global palate, danced with flavors that were at once familiar and novel. Patatas bravas, a dish steeped in tradition, were reborn here, fiery and bold. The beef carpaccio, a testament to the art of simplicity, melted away on the tongue, leaving behind a longing for just one more bite.

As we ventured into the main course, the narrative deepened. The duck confit risotto was a masterful blend of textures and tastes, each grain of rice telling a story of craftsmanship and care. The glazed beef short ribs, tender to the point of poetry, were glazed in a sauce that could only be described as liquid gold. The rack of lamb, an ode to the pastoral, was a symphony of succulence and seasoning, while the tournedos, a ballet of beef at its most tender and flavorful, performed gracefully on the palate. The chef's special miso black cod, a dish of understated elegance, whispered secrets of the sea with every forkful.

Ah, the grand finale of our gastronomic ballet at Barnea, where the curtain call was as sweet as the symphony preceding it. Dessert is, after all, the encore that every foodie soul yearns for, a final note that lingers long after the performance has ended. And what a standing ovation our choices garnered!

The Key Lime Pie, not merely a dessert but a voyage, transported us to the sun-drenched groves of Florida with each bite. Its delicate balance of tart and sweet sang a duet with the buttery, crumbly crust, a harmony so divine that even the angels paused to listen. This was not just a pie; it was a slice of bliss, a creamy whisper of dreams made tangible.

La Noisette, on the other hand, was a masterclass in the art of subtlety and sophistication. A ballet of hazelnuts, chocolate, and cream that pirouetted across the palate with grace and elegance. Each spoonful was a brushstroke of flavor, painting a portrait of indulgence that was as exquisite to the eye as it was to the taste. This dessert was a love letter to the senses, penned in the language of sweetness and texture.

To dine at Barnea is to partake in a feast for the senses, a testament to the art of cooking, and a reminder of the joy that can be found in a meal not just eaten, but experienced. Would I do it all over again? In a New York heartbeat.",5
261,Barnea Bistro,"211 E 46th St, New York, NY 10017, USA",4.7,Zissy Kahana,"We had the most amazing experiene at Barnea. Nadia was on her game picking up on our cues, offering very on point advice on menu options, checking in, and taking care of our order perfectly. She was super friendly yet so professional. Perfectly balanced. The food is what brings us back again and again. There is artistry in the layers, components, and flavoring of every dish. The gnocchi was the best one we ever had, the meat was a perfect medium rare. The desserts decedent. Cocktails are always a hit at Barnea! We will definitely be back!",5

They ordered the Chicken Shack Burger along with some Spicy Korean BBQ Cheese Fries and iced tea. Let me tell you, both the food and the overall atmosphere exceeded our expectations.

The Spicy Korean BBQ Cheese Fries were a delightful treat. The crispy crinkle cuts were perfectly cooked and had just the right amount of crunch. Topped with a generous amount of cheese sauce spiced with kimchi seasoning, these fries were bursting with flavor. The side of Korean BBQ sauce added a tangy and savory kick that took them to the next level. It was undoubtedly a hit with all of us.

As for the Chicken Shack Burger, it quickly became a favorite among both of our kids. The crispy, white-meat chicken breast was cooked to perfection and had a delicious crunch. It was served on a toasted potato bun, topped with lettuce, pickles, and a flavorful buttermilk herb mayo. It's safe to say that our kids, who are highly recommend trying this burger.

In addition to the fantastic food, the staff was friendly and attentive. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the kids felt comfortable and had a great time.

When we came in they sat us at a table that nearly didn't stand and kept rocking and tipping. We had to ask for menus 3 times, the waiter told us the specials before we even had a menu in our hands. The bread we were served almost cracked a tooth it was so stale. On the menu, quite a limited selection of food, including only a few pasta options. I got the salmon, thought it was pretty steep to be $39 but figured it would be a decent sized piece and come with a few sides. My fianc√© got the bolognese. Please just take a look at the photo to see what you'd get for $39 salmon. A very hard and unripe tomato next to a piece of grilled salmon. Not a side on the plate - typically served with mashed potatoes, spinach, etc. the bolognese was disgusting. I spoke with the manager who was dismissive and told the waiter to get me a side dish. It was cold asparagus. Finally, we got the bill wanting to get out of there as fast as possible. I opened the bill and they charged us $9 for WATER. Let me tell you. Never go to this place.

The only disappointing part of this evening was the service. We wanted to order the 2nd round of drinks before the happy hour cut, and the server denied them for friends with half full glasses. Then we all ordered main plates, and while still working on our food the waiter brought us the check. We didn't give it too much thought, as we weren't done and wanted to also enjoy desserts. So we ordered their flan and dessert wines and were trying to enjoy the evening. That's when the waiter told us to hurry up because they needed the table for someone else.
It was exactly 1 hour from the time we sat at the table until we were asked to empty the table.
Not the best feeling for your $60+ pp cost. I wouldn't come back here just because of the service. If they were upfront that we get only 1hr at the table, that would have been more fair.",3

I finally got to visit the store in Midtown on one weekend for lunch. The staff (lovely Japanese female) told me that shortly before we arrived, a large group of people came and bought out most of their bento boxes!!! So, there was not much selections left‚Ä¶ And, it seems like their donburi items are offered during weekdays, not on weekends. Double punch there‚Ä¶

We looked through their limited options, and picked up a few things that still looked really great. Since there is no seating in this location, we decided to take them home. The first item was their Pork Cutlet Curry, which comes with a small drink of your choice. We also bought a couple of rice balls and a Chocolate Mochi Doughnut.

They were all rather simple yet comforting and pretty good flavor. I was super happy I finally got to visit BentOn. I would definitely go back again when I want something quick, comforting, tasty, and Japanese. They are super affordable, and if you get there before they ran out of their offerings, it is pretty enticing and exciting.

I used to eat regularly at their downtown location near Wall St,, which is unfortunately closed, and which used to allow full customization of the bento box (i.e. build-your-own).
The Midtown location doesn't have this setup,   but they offer multiple pre-prepared options to choose from. They also have a very interesting Ramen option, and the quality of the bento is exceptional.
