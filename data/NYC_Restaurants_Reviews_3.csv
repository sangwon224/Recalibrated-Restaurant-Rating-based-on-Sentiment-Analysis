I especially love their pastas! Both pastas we ordered were very good. Also, the duck dish was amazing, it was perfectly cooked. Love love love!  The desserts were a bit too sweet for my preference but they were still good with coffee. I will definitely come back next time.",5
2,Marea,"240 Central Park S, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.5,Angelique Swann,"Stop everything. If you're coming to upper east do whatever you have to and get a reservation. This is the reason NYC stands out as an Epicurus's center!  Exquisite care taken to every flavor and detail to balance the plate. Amazing wine list.  Causal and friendly. Pastry chef is imaginative and makes dessert so worth it. Just do it! Do not delay. This is why we dine out! Order octopus. Gnocchi. Sea bass over risotto, and scallops that taste like the sea kissed you on the lips! leave room for spice cake and cheese tray with honey and raspberry olive oil preserves. The sorbet is exquisite ! Great for date night or business dinner. Small bar. Neighborhood vibe despite upscale prices. I ‚ù§Ô∏è New York for restaurants just like this one!",5
3,Marea,"240 Central Park S, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.5,Benjamin Hammer,"What a special evening at Marea.  It‚Äôs long been on my list, and now I see why it is still around.  It may be expensive; however, you get what you pay for.  We started with cocktails: the Marea Martini is something truly special, so smooth and delicious with a hint of Calabrian chili oil.  We then had some oysters (a cucumber and lemon mignonette, unique and delicious) and the hamachi crudo (divine).  We split the lobster parpardelle arrabiata (spicy and pasta heaven) and the scallops (huge and sweet and yummy).  We ended the meal with an insanely delicious take on tiramisu with a mascarpone gelato that was slightly salty.  All in all a wonderful feel and a would DEFINITELY go back.",5
4,Marea,"240 Central Park S, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.5,Matt Smith,"The food and service here are amazing. I had the lobster burrata, fusilli octopus, and grilled sirloin, and the tiramisu for dessert. Highly recommend all off the above. The portions were surprisingly large so don't worry that you'll be leaving hungry. üòã",5
5,Marea,"240 Central Park S, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.5,Samuel Friedfeld,Good not great.  Not what it used to be.  Food didn‚Äôt seem to have the same presentation and flavor as it used to be during the peak 10+ years ago.  Service was good and attentive but pasta took very long to come out.  Place is nice looking but I miss it being a stuffier crowd.,4
6,Guantanamera,"939 8th Ave, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.4,Adam Ford,"The live Cuban trio was fun, if loud. The black beans met all expectations, the skirt steak was tender and lovely, the salmon was fine--the peppers and onions surrounding the salmon were great. The whiskey sours were on point and very good. Great little spot north of the theater district. Definitely recommended.",5
7,Guantanamera,"939 8th Ave, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.4,Preethi Raju,"Fun, lively spot with a live band. Somehow got a table on Friday night. Sea bass, chicken, yuca fries, papas rellenas, and beans were great. Tres leches was awesome. Was limited for vegetarians, but we expected it. The veggie paella was full of veggies which my husband liked but wasn‚Äôt as rich as the other foods. Super awesome staff!",5
8,Guantanamera,"939 8th Ave, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.4,Celeste Cartagena,"The food is always good!!!! I gave service a 3 because my guest felt rushed by the wait staff to finish and leave. Three different wait persons came to remove his plate, but he wasn't done eating.

I gave the atmosphere a 3 because as I was dining, two children began yelling out (enough to be disruptive), but their parent thought it was cute as opposed to what it really was, disruptive.

I've been here several times, and this is the first time any of this has happened.",3
9,Guantanamera,"939 8th Ave, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.4,Ana Llapa,"Came upon this place on a google search, for a very late dinner. Post a show at about 1115pm, we went to have some Cuban food.  The atmosphere was great, great salsa music and then live salsa music!  Which was great even though it was near closing time. The decor was still Christmas which was super cute.  I had the Cuban sandwich which was good! And my hubby had the vaca frita.  The beans definitely needed some seasoning and salt, overall He liked his dish.  We also ordered tostones rellenos with shrimp, I can‚Äôt say it was my favorite.  The staff were super friendly and the food came out super fast! They didn‚Äôt rush us which was comforting to eat and not feel rushed. I ordered a traditional mojito and was not happy with it at all.  Unfortunately it was just not tasty, no flavor, it looked pretty but tasted just like alcohol.  The food portions were just right, not too big not too small.  Maybe next time we will come earlier and try during the day.",4
10,Guantanamera,"939 8th Ave, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.4,Jesus Hernandez,"This place was so good and there were so many great dishes in their menu that we returned the next night for dinner again. The place has a very nice ambient, servers are super nice and very attentive.  We had the Pollo al Coco, the Churrasco with Chimichurri and the Pollo Guajira with tostones, amarillos and withe rice with frijoles. Everything was delicious. Desert was awesome too! Highly recommended to get a reservation.",5

Their shakes and chocolate cake are INSANE! See my photo- huge cake slice and it tastes great.
This spot has a lot of tourists and the service is so good, they are super efficient and the food is always great.
I enjoy sitting at the outdoor tables, great people watching and I like the proximity to Central Park.",5

I can never ever decide between the
CHICKEN sandwich and the BURGER but didn't have to at this spot (And each half was delicious and cooked perfectly and had BACON)

Also got a chance to indulge in the French toast topped with Bacon, sugar walnuts, caramel and sweet MARSCAPONE - such a perfect combo!",5

My son and I both enjoyed our visit to All Stars Sports Bar & Grill. This place has been on my son‚Äôs bookmarks for a while now. Today, we were finally able to check them out. We sat at the bar area to order our drinks and meals.

We decided to order the All Star Superstar Burger which was Angus beef topped with mac & cheese, bacon, onion rings, lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles. It was also served with fries.

My son ordered mozzarella sticks and onion rings from the appetizer menu. All of the food was absolutely delicious. We truly enjoyed our visit and dining experience here. Adam was the bartender working the bar area and doing an exceptional job serving customers.",5
17,All Stars Sports Bar & Grill,"327 W 57th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.3,Joseph Ferraro,"Went with my brothers to catch up. We were sat right away. Food was really good but the nachos are just incredible. A huge plate that will fill you up easily if you‚Äôre not careful. And the sauce that comes with the Sliders was probably the best sauce I‚Äôve ever had. It was some sort of chipotle sauce. A little pricey but I would go back, it‚Äôs a great sports atmosphere.",4
18,All Stars Sports Bar & Grill,"327 W 57th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.3,Geraldine Etienne,"This is the perfect place for sports fanatics. It is NFL and NBA season.

Buffalo wings
Philly Cheesesteak
Grilled cheese Short Rib
Jerk Chicken Rasta Pasta

Mexican Sangria
Gin Smash
Loaded Aperol
Frozen Margarita
Pink Potion #327

My favorite was a short rib grilled cheese.. a hefty, flavorful sandwich. The jerk chicken rasta pasta caught me by surprise for a place that isn't a Caribbean bar/ restaurant to have a pretty tasty rasta pasta. Right amount of spice, juicy chicken and nice texture and flavors of the sauce. The wings are good but it's actually on the spicier side. I really enjoyed the Mexican Sangria which has mezcal and red wine; it was strong. They even have daily specials with deals on drinks and food",5
19,All Stars Sports Bar & Grill,"327 W 57th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.3,Juan J. Moreno,"Small, friendly, Irish spot bar. The menu is the usual in this kind of bar (Burguer, chicken, sandwiches, several alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks). What we ordered was pretty well cooked and tasty. The honey mustard was great, don't know if it's home made. The bar has several TVs, well located to watch any match. Service is friendly and efficient.",4
20,All Stars Sports Bar & Grill,"327 W 57th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.3,Jade M.,"Small bar but there‚Äôs two main floors. Huge tvs all over playing multiple games. Service a little slow but we got our appetizer first so it held us off for a bit. We ordered a 6 piece honey bbq wings with loaded nachos with grilled chicken and a pitcher of beer for about $80. The nachos were delicious. Great tasting guacamole, grilled chicken, honestly everything was good. I‚Äôm not much of a nacho person but that was tasty. And the chicken wings that came out were perfect‚Äîhot, crispy thin skin with big and juicy meat.. probably the best wings I‚Äôve ever had. Beer is beer. Staff was friendly. Atmosphere isn‚Äôt crazy.",5
21,ROBERT,"2 Columbus Cir, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.5,Jonathan Austin,"Excellent food and service.  Definitely will be back. Great atmosphere with sprawling views of Central Park accompanied by live piano.  The dishes were creative and well portioned.  Service was top-notch, and I found myself wanting for nothing.  What an amazing place.",5
22,ROBERT,"2 Columbus Cir, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.5,Sawako Y,"4.5 / 5.0 - My friends and I came here for brunch on Easter Sunday and were in for a fun surprise.

Robert is on top of the Museum of Arts and Design, with impressive views of Columbus Circle and Central Park. We‚Äôd made reservations in advance but unfortunately were unable to sit by the windows with views. We still had a very enjoyable meal in this spacious and stylish restaurant.

We ordered the Rigatoni ($25+), Lobster Roll ($21+) and Scrambled Eggs & Caviar ($28+). The complimentary basket of bread and muffins was a nice addition.

The food was good, but the highlight for me was the festive atmosphere and Easter treats. They had a cotton candy stand, where they offered free cotton candy. And during our meal, an Easter bunny came around, waving and posing for photos.

I‚Äôm not sure how they celebrate other holidays, but I would love to be back again for more unique experiences as well as the views.",5
23,ROBERT,"2 Columbus Cir, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.5,Udit Anand,"We had a phenomenal lunch at Robert! The ambience, the views, the service, and the food were a fantastic experience.

We greatly enjoyed the Rigatoni (flavorful and balanced taste, great presented), the Amish Chicken (juicy and tasty!), Shishito Peppers, and Jasmine Tea.

Last but not least, the Sweet Potato Creme Brulee was novel but oh so delicious, and the complimentary Macaroons were a lovely way to cap off an excellent dining experience. Highly recommend!",5
24,ROBERT,"2 Columbus Cir, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.5,Jinhyun Lee,"I really enjoyed the meal i had in this restaurant. Salmon was perfectly cooked(well done but not too dry) , the staffs were too kind, and the view was amazing. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone",5
25,ROBERT,"2 Columbus Cir, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.5,Diane Beyer,"Soup was delicious but needed seasoning.  Salmon was a good portion size but sauce was under- seasoned and desperately needed salt.  Dessert was absolutely delicious!  Service was fair.  Overall, I would recommend this place and look forward to retuning the next time I visit.",4
26,SOUTHGATE Bar & Restaurant,"154 Central Park S, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.1,Liliia Glynianiuk,"I love this place, we celebrated with my friend New Year and it was awesome. The atmosphere was nice, even when it was busy time the waitress payed enough time to us, suggesting nice wine. The manager Ernesto Rufin helped us  the next day when we came and asked about lost AirPod.
I definitely recommend this place with nice warm atmosphere!",5
27,SOUTHGATE Bar & Restaurant,"154 Central Park S, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.1,Vahe Yacoubian,"This place is a bit overpriced, and while the food is good I can‚Äôt say it matches the price. If you are staying at this hotel with some friends, and trying to catch up on a Sunday afternoon then I‚Äôd say go for it. Otherwise, Manhattan is filled with much better places to get a bite to eat at a more reasonable price. Plus it‚Äôll come with larger portions than what you‚Äôre paying for.

Pictured: shrimp tacos, spinach gnocchi, beet salad, filet mignon sliders (so tender), branzino, cobb salad

Hotel breakfast buffet offered a welcomed range of fruit, though could have more hot food options for the $41/person price point.

The highlight must be the service. Waters and juices were constantly being refilled. Each and every staff was patient, gracious, down-to-earth, and a delight to converse with. Really elevated my stay at the hotel.",5

I've been there on multiple occasions.  They are speedy, thr food taste fresh and they keep the dining room in check.

A lot of traffic so it can get dirty fast. But they keep at it. They recently started to kick out the delivery guys from loitering because they got in to a scuffle amongst each other. I respect that. I am all about the delivery folks, but sometimes they just sit there and hang out. It's not just this location, it's other fast food joints in general.

They also kick out the homeless people. A few days ago, a staff member kicked out a homeless person who was digging through the trash. He literally picked out a cup and filled the cup with soda.

Glad she kicked him out. Kudos!",5

They must cook a lot of fries all day long and let them sit and then give them to people that's nasty they musta killed a baby chick cuz I don't know what that little piece is on top of the box LOL could have got salmonella poisoning cause chicken wasn't done. Only thing good about this meal at this time was the biscuit. Have to start bring my lunch again. Bought this meal at the same store off of 8th avenue w 40th st. as I did the first but it wouldn't let me do another review on that store,2

Their chicken is juicy, tender, and covered in a butter flakey coating. The fries are great! Get the blackened ranch and you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Or try the spicy chicken sandwich.

Service: This spot happens to be the cleanest McDonald I have been so far in the US. They do well in terms of keeping things at their places (chairs, napkins etc.)

Atmosphere, there are some people hanging around as a typical McDonald. On the day I went, there was a guy talking to himself with some herbs on the table. I think that's acceptable as long as he does not disturb/harm others, but that's something to be noted if you were to bring your kids for a HappyMeal.",4
66,Patsy's Italian Restaurant,"236 W 56th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.3,Tara Geary,"I ordered the Ravioli trio (but replaced the mushroom one, with cheese ravioli) They were all delicious, but the menu says that each one comes with a distinctive sauce, and if they were different, I couldn't tell.  It had a nice atmosphere though. A very cozy, family owned business that's been around forever, and has TONS of history and photos to prove it.  Dessert is an absolute must! My son went crazy over their chocolate mousse cake, and I ate my cannoli cake so fast I didn't even get a chance to snap a picture.  It was AWESOME! I will warn you though- the soda glasses are the tiniest you've ever seen, and at $4.50 a pop they do not provide free refills.  Not a big deal, just something to be aware of.  There is also an upstairs, but we didn't go up there so I can't say what's up there.  Overall, a great place for a good Italian dinner! üëç üëç",4

71,Pizza Hut,"932 8th Ave, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.0,S√©bastien Dutton,"This place is chaos every single time I go, with half a dozen plus people all crammed into the tiny store, waiting. The food has generally improved since opening, but generally improving from awful is still not where it should be. I've received orders of breadsticks and received no sauce on two occasions. On another occasion I received breadsticks that were literally just sticks of bread with none of the seasoning or anything on them. Ordered a bunch of pizza for a party and it was all so burnt that it was basically inedible. It's almost always something. I reached out to their Twitter customer service the first few times there were issues, but even they got tired of it and told me to reach out to the store directly, as if it were possible to get a hold of anyone there.",2
72,Pizza Hut,"932 8th Ave, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.0,J E,Horrible. The food is always inconsistent. I am always missing marinara sauce for the breadsticks and recently they increased. Their prices absurdly on Uber eats the typical order that I place is $42 originally and is now $96 GTFO. I guess I am done ordering Pizza Hut. Hello Domino‚Äôs again there‚Äôs way too much competition in this town to be price gouging like that especially when you‚Äôre serving terrible inconsistent food.,1

74,Pizza Hut,"932 8th Ave, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.0,Paul Chung,"Where do I begin with what might possibly be the worst Pizza Hut in America. This store constantly messes up orders (I ordered a supreme pizza as seen in the receipt for the pizza compared to the meatball that I got) is consistently an hour or more delayed in delivery of the food, and has their phone line disconnected as soon as your press 3 to try and connect to the restaurant directly. This is honestly the most disappointing Pizza Hut I‚Äôve ever been to or ordered from. What a shame that this is the only Pizza Hut in Manhattan, clearly corporate oversight is nonexistent as can be evidenced by the pictures from the other reviews as well as my own experiences from the two times I ordered from this store. The first was during the recent Super Bowl, so I wanted to give the store the benefit of the doubt‚Ä¶but when I ordered again on a normal weekday (3/15/23) night, the same delay, issues, and lack of resolution from anyone at the store or through corporate.

I was craving the Pizza Hut taste from childhood, but I should have realized this particular store is the epitome of failure and nothing is going to be fixed anytime soon. Do yourself a favor and do not order for delivery at this store. You‚Äôre going to be in an endless loop with the automated phone line and corporate all to get incorrect, room temperature food about an hour after the slated delivery time.

Edited (3/16/23): I did get a hold of their corporate line and while they were effusively apologizing when offering a refund, nothing the phone operator said gave me any assurance that corporate would be following up with this store. I just wouldn‚Äôt risk ordering delivery from this place. Maybe it‚Äôs better in-person for pick-up, but delivering 2 avenues over is too much for this nascent store at this time.",1

76,Bistro Verde,"225 W 57th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.0,O V H,I wanted to love this place but I didn't.  The food is delicious BUT always a few issues.  The bread on the eggs Benedict was Challah bread that was dry and too thick. The lobster bisque was too rich. Pure cream pretty much.  The roast beef was overcooked for me. I like it on the rare side. The service both times was not good. I was left with no water for ten minutes and got a refill only after having to flag down a waiter.

The weather was perfect and I noticed they had opened an outdoor terrace. I asked to be seated outside. It was quite enjoyable, I must say. The waiter was pleasant and prompt, and went over the menu with me in depth. I will say that they could invest in outdoor umbrellas and more foliage to make it a bit more cozy.

I settled on the Rigatoni & Chicken Sausage, which was perfectly seasoned and not overly spicy. The garlic bread that came with it was delicious as well. I always enjoy coming to Nordstrom do dine at their restaurants because the food is always delicious and the staff is always so pleasant. I remember conversing with the manager of the restaurant one time, and I complimented him on the staff. He then told me that his main focus was to hire ‚Äùgreat people‚Äù. That always stuck with me because they have been trained well and are an asset to Bistro Verde.",5

Went out to dinner with my partner and his sister while spending time in New York City and decided to try Trattoria Dell'Arte and we all loved the experience.

For an appetizer we chose 3 items from the appetizer bar, and enjoyed the mix of flavors.

For my entree, I ordered the rigatoni a la vodka and enjoyed my dish.  The vodka sauce was fantastic and fresh while the pasta tasted home made.

My partner and his sister ordered the ravioli with a pomodoro sauce and both loved the pasta.

Easy to miss this one as you need to go down stairs from street level to an underground food court. They have some run-of-the-mill rice plates but where they really shine is their malatong- an (optionally) spicy, hearty pot chock full of noodles, veggies, and a meat of your choosing.

I was skeptical at first about the popcorn chicken for the price but when I tried it after a few visits here, I was delighted to find the helping was generous and full of flavor. It comes with a spicy mayo for dipping as well.

Having been to a skewer shop in China, I can confirm these were very authentic- and very delicious! They brought back memories of the skewers there that I had almost forgotten!

The popcorn chicken was just as delicious, and the spicy mayo sauce they came with was delectable!

The beef malatong was the cherry on top, rich and delicious broth, loaded with very thinly sliced savory beef and the perfect amount of yummy vegetables.

We also realise that they serve the food in a stack of plates which adds the extravagant of the meal. However, I do notice that the utensil are very scratched.

We started the meal at 16.30. And it lasted till 20.30. It took a while for the food to come. But since they have a lot of food for us, I think its a good call since we dont feel too full and we can finish the whole meal. Thank god we didn‚Äôt have anything plan for the rest of the night as we did not expect it to be a 4 hour meal.

Really really great pasta. The best I‚Äôve had so far during my trip to NY. I got penne alla vodka (creamy) which was full of flavour, al dente pasta, and a good sized ported. My brother got the spaghetti pomodoro which he really enjoyed. My dad got the pollo parmigiana which was massive! Really huge pieces of chicken that also tasted delicious.

I would advise you make a reservation as it is very busy. Service was really good. Only thing was no one came to the table with Parmesan for our pasta so we did have to get a waiters attention before we could start eating. In the uk Parmesan is always brought out to the table but I‚Äôm unsure if that‚Äôs a thing here in NYC.

I would say soda was more expensive for a really tiny bottle compared to other places we‚Äôve eaten.

Pasta prices ranged from 23-30 dollars so compared to UK it‚Äôs extremely expensive but it‚Äôs decent prices for NYC and it‚Äôs one of the best places we‚Äôve been too so for us this was absolutely worth the money. Will definitely be back before we leave.",5

The main dining room is the full Jean Georges experience, which is the pre-fix fancier menu. Nougatine is in the bar area and a little more laid back but still outstanding in its own right. Unfortunately, the main dining room is only open for dinner now. I used to go there quite a bit for lunch, so that is kind of a bummer. With that being said, both restaurants are fantastic.

The vibe inside is cozy and elegant, and the sushi is out of this world. You can tell they use only the freshest and highest quality fish, as each bite melts in your mouth and bursts with flavor. The presentation is also stunning, with colorful and creative dishes that make you want to take a picture before you dig in.

The menu is not your typical sushi place, as they offer some other cooked options that are equally delicious. I loved the crispy rice with ahi tuna, the popcorn shrimp, and the cauliflower tempura. If you want to splurge, the Blue Ribbon Roll with lobster and the spicy crab roll are phenomenal options. They are pricey, but worth every penny.

The service is very fast and efficient, even when the place gets busy. The staff is friendly and attentive, and they make sure you have a great experience. I definitely recommend making a reservation, as this place is very popular and can get crowded.

Served on a bed of cold bean thread noodles for a whopping $36!!! Unbelievable. Astonishing how bad it was. There is a pic posted of The Maki sashimi ($32) which was old and fishy tasting and smelling in a bad way. You know when it is old.  It was awful. Inedible. We couldn‚Äôt eat it. We also ordered 3 sushi rolls which were mediocre at best but we ate them because we were hungry!  For the price point, you kind hope for better quality.

Chai Thai NYC offers a mixed bag of experiences, blending delectable cuisine with subpar service. Nestled in the heart of the city, this tiny restaurant promises an authentic Thai dining adventure but falls short in hospitality.

Let's start with the positive‚Äîthe food. Chai Thai delivers on its culinary promise with a menu boasting an array of traditional Thai dishes bursting with flavor and authenticity. From aromatic curries to zesty stir-fries, each dish is crafted with care and precision, showcasing the rich tapestry of Thai cuisine. The flavors dance on your palate, transporting you to the bustling streets of Bangkok. Highlights include the fragrant Tom Yum soup, the creamy Panang curry, and the mouthwatering Pad Thai, each dish a testament to the chef's skill and dedication.

However, the dining experience is marred by the lackluster service and questionable billing practices. The staff at Chai Thai, regrettably, leave much to be desired. From the moment you step foot into the cramped establishment, it becomes apparent that customer service is not their top priority. The waitstaff's demeanor borders on indifference, with little to no effort made to welcome or assist patrons. Despite the restaurant's diminutive size, getting the attention of a server can feel like an uphill battle. Requests for additional condiments or drink refills are met with sighs and eye rolls, leaving diners feeling like an inconvenience rather than valued guests.

Adding insult to injury, Chai Thai has a knack for nickel-and-diming its customers. Extra charges seem to crop up at every turn, turning what should be an enjoyable dining experience into a financial headache. Whether it's a nominal fee for substituting one ingredient for another or an unexpected surcharge for basic condiments, the restaurant's pricing structure feels exploitative and deceptive. Diners should beware of these hidden costs, which can quickly inflate the final bill without warning.

Moreover, the restaurant's reluctance to provide attentive service extends to the dining experience itself. Despite the cramped quarters, the staff appears content to remain behind the counter, rarely venturing out to check on patrons or ensure their satisfaction. This lack of engagement fosters an atmosphere of neglect, leaving diners feeling abandoned and overlooked.

In conclusion, Chai Thai NYC offers a tantalizing glimpse into the world of Thai cuisine, with dishes that delight the taste buds and transport diners to distant shores. However, the restaurant's charm is overshadowed by its glaring shortcomings in customer service and transparency. While the food may be worth the visit, be prepared to endure rude staff, unexpected charges, and a dining experience that falls short of expectations. For those seeking an authentic taste of Thailand without the hassle, Chai Thai NYC may leave them craving more than just good food.",3
159,Chai Thai Kitchen,"930 8th Ave, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.1,Aniket Soni,"Upon entry, the host directed us to a table, but then promptly asked us to move to a corner one. The server inquired if we were vegan, and upon learning we were vegetarian, mentioned something about a 'happy sauce' or possibly oyster sauce. We were confused and sought clarification about the sauce, but the server vaguely indicated that it was in all dishes except two, pointing them out in the menu without further explanation, and then left.

We requested room temperature water, which the server initially brought but then took away and didn't return for another 5-10 minutes. When it came to ordering, we weren't very hungry and chose one appetizer and one main course. However, we were informed of a $15 minimum spend per person, compelling us to order another appetizer.

The Veg Dumplings were delicious, served without any sauce. The Veg Spring Rolls were tasty but too oily, accompanied by a sauce. The Veg Fried Rice, however, was bland, tasting of raw vegetables without any seasoning. We ended up using the sauce from the spring rolls to add some flavor to it.

The service felt rushed. As soon as we finished with a dish, the server immediately cleared the plates. This haste was also evident when my wife finished her meal; the server quickly removed her plate, giving the impression that they wanted us to leave promptly.

Regarding the bill, we paid the amount and included a tip, despite our dissatisfaction with the service and the minimum spend requirement. The server then returned to inquire about gratuity based on the suggested amount on the invoice. After we confirmed our tip, she followed us out of the restaurant, asking if there was something wrong with the service. It was uncomfortable and awkward, particularly when she insisted we write on the invoice that the service was satisfactory.

Overall, our visit to Chai Thai Kitchen was disappointing. While some dishes were enjoyable, the service and the overall experience were not up to par. I am unlikely to return or recommend this place to others.",1

The greens were a tad bitter but no big deal. The clam chowder was decent.  There were lots of claims in there. And the beet salad with vegan cheese was excellent.  The cheese was a tad too sour. I think the salad could have used a drizzle of honey. The waitresses here are EXCELLENT!,4

The food was amazing and the chef showed us a presentation of the whole thing. I thought the entire experience was amazing and I would definitely come back to this restaurant.

We said the hours say 6 but the answer was that last seating is at 5 and last order is 5:20.  There was no sign saying it was closed and they acted as if we should have known.  It‚Äôs a pity because this was a good go to.,1

Delicious foods and Kind staff. Pizza and Steak were really good. Appetizer meat ball was so good. Chef Han explained me each of dishes. Have to say Thank you.

I will definitely come back again soon!",5

We had an excellent lunch here. Fresh, interesting, very pleasant server, quick. This is a find for a casual lunch or supper in midtown that won‚Äôt break the bank. Attractive space. Very good cocktails and they do a happy hour too. I would highly recommend.",5
172,ABA Turkish Restaurant,"325 W 57th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.3,Ahmed Al-Shaer,"One of the best Turkish restaurants in NYC. The lamb doner was the best, in my opinion. They offer Halal food, and the bill for dine-in includes the service fee/tips by default.",5

175,ABA Turkish Restaurant,"325 W 57th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.3,Jiao Zhang,"I always love Mediterranean cuisine and especially Turkish. The food is authentic and flavorful. Good quantity and fair priced. The interior is not super outstanding but classic and good enough. I love the free warm bread they give before the meal. The olive oil sprinkled with or√©gano is the best simple bread dip. The Shepard salad is also my favorite, fresh and well-balanced flavored with vintage. The Adana chicken is also full with middle eastern spice, well marinated. The service is quick too. Overall, a casual place for good Turkish food.",5

All the staff was unwelcoming and plain rude. The portions were incredibly small for the price and they didn't even have tomato; there was no working soda machine, they only had canned coke and sprite, nothing diet/zero. To top it off, the place is dirty, both trashcans were FULL, literally don't go, it's not worth it.",1
179,Chipotle Mexican Grill,"235 W 56th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",3.8,Anthony,"This Chipotle has the laziest employees I have ever experienced. Multiple times I've been refused service 40 mins before closing time. I've also seen them, 2 hours before closing, claim to be out of an ingredient, then get that ingredient from the back for an online order.

I can only assume they are trying to get away with doing as little work as possible by not serving their in-person customers so they can close and go home early.

Go to any of the other nearby Chipotles if you're considering coming here remotely close to 10PM when they're supposed to close.",1

Went to store to pick up my burrito bowl, mentioned that to the cashier, she said ‚Äúto claim that reward you have to buy something‚Äù I said ‚ÄúI did and I‚Äôm here waiting to pickup my burrito bowl‚Äù. She said ‚Äúno you have to buy something in store‚Äù. What kind of rule is that? Online reward but have to buy something in store? That doesn‚Äôt even make sense.",2

The atmosphere is alright and if you are looking to grab a tea or coffee before attending a concert in Carnegie (that's what we did) the place is absolutely perfect for that.
The latte was okay .",4

Maybe Google Maps mixed things up? Anyway, their pizza was top-notch and totally worth another visit, although it was a tad pricey, but that's expected around Central Park.

We decided to try their promoted sangria, but it didn't hit the mark, especially for around $15 a glass. Disappointing, to be honest. Despite that, their pizza was exquisite‚Äîthe main reason to drop by a spot like this.",3

Central Park Cafe:  Nice, clean for NYC, wine while you wait, and about a 15 - 20 min wait for a 12‚Äù.  Good?  OMG SO GOOD.  Not Greecie, no oil dripping, just good oil Italian/NYC PIZZA.  So surprised because of the other reviews, but the wait was worth it.  YES, order a drink and just enjoy the time of calm while you wait for a non-greecie PIZZA.  Your tummy will love it.",5

190,Pizza and Shakes,"209 W 57th St, New York, NY 10019, USA",4.3,David F,"Not traditional NYC pizza, but good pizza here.  They have oval pizzas that one would expect from the &pizza chain and is more colloquially known as Pizza alla Pala.

Most run about $15 each.

I tried three types:
-country style: signature tomato basil sauce, pepperoni, bacon, meatballs, mozzarella, sweet onion sauce

-quatreto: white garlic sauce, shredded mozzarella, ricotta cheese, fresh mozzarella, Parmesan cheese, garlic Parmesan sauce

-the swift: spicy tomato sauce, Parmesan cheese, pepperoni, jalapenos, roasted red peppers, Nashville hot sauce

My favorite was the country style. Good amount of the topping and the sweet onion sauce brings it out together.  The quatreto was also good.  Had an interesting mesh of cheeses joined together by the garlic sauce.  The swift was okay.  It needs a bit more flavorful Nashville hot sauce IMHO.

I'd come back and try the other pies.",5

I had a wonderful time with my 12 year old brother.

Kid friendly. Great service.

And an amazing value for quality/ price in such a highly concentrated tourist area.

One pizza is definitely enough for 2 people.

Gelato is amazing!! Banana Nutella and Ferero Rocher flavors were Divine.

This bar is located inside of Nordstrom. The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing. The staff is friendly and welcoming and immediately sat my party and I upon arrival.

I ordered a burger and fries (to share) and the Next Flight Out cocktail ($12 at Happy Hour). The prices were great and they kindly cut and separately plated the burger for my friend and I to share. Everything was delicious!

If you‚Äôre in the area, this relaxed laid back bar is definitely worth visiting.",5

A great break after or during shopping with amazing cocktails with fresh ingredients.  I highly recommend the blueberry blush made with fresh lavender!,5
