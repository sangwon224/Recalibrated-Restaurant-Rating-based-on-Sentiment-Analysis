1,Henry Street Ale House,"62 Henry St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.3,Tom Gubernat,"An excellent pub in Brooklyn Heights. The bartender and entire staff are on point, swift and smart. The food is good pub fare, I had the fried chicken sandwich, and while a bit dry, it hit the spot. I‚Äôll be back as often as I can for this staple in NYC pubs. Nachos are great!",4
2,Henry Street Ale House,"62 Henry St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.3,Abhishek Jaddu,"The girlfriend and I weren‚Äôt terribly impressed with this place. All the food we got was not in line with what we had expected. We were especially disappointed by the chicken tenders, which were nothing like the stereotypical chicken tender you‚Äôre going to get anywhere else. They‚Äôre battered with tiny (I mean tiny) slivers of chicken. Don‚Äôt think we will go back if we are craving bar food of any kind. Fried pickles were decent though.",3
3,Henry Street Ale House,"62 Henry St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.3,Christian Zinner,"Lovely place to stop by, I haven't had the chance to take a table but we sat at the bar and it was very convenient. From the Guinness and the fries everything delicious. Even though we had some difficulties with paying the bartender was very polite in hinting us how to pay properly",5
4,Henry Street Ale House,"62 Henry St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.3,Natalya Vershinina,Pub in Brooklyn. It is truly a Pub with big choice of draft and can beer. We got roast beef sandwich that supposed to be with the gravy and it was so dry and beef was so old not fresh at all plus fries was so saggy and greasy. Not good experience for bar food. I guess this spot is still good to hang out with friends and get a beer but food make sure you go somewhere else.,2
5,Henry Street Ale House,"62 Henry St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.3,Howard,"Great little watering hole with a surprisingly strong food offering. It looks like the normal pub-grub on the menu (burger, fish and chips) but was all really high caliber and freshly prepared. We were there on a quiet Sunday afternoon and it seems to be set-back far enough from the Dumbo tourist crowd to avoid being packed out, which is a shame for them but makes it a bit of a hidden treasure.
Excellent beer options and friendly staff too.",5
6,Grimaldi's Pizzeria,"1 Front St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.2,Kay Jay,"Highly recommend making your way to this pizzeria to try out their pizza! We ordered the 18‚Äô‚Äô margherita. We decided to order the most basic pizza to check if it is any good. A lot of times, people try to add so many things onto a pizza to confuse consumers. We believe that if their basic pizza is delicious, then the rest should be equally awesome. And they delivered! We were very satisfied with their pizza. We were not that hungry going there, but we finished everything to the last bits. Would go back there again when I am back in NYC to try out other pizza on their menu!",5
7,Grimaldi's Pizzeria,"1 Front St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.2,Doug Bush,"Food was good but I‚Äôve had it before and I remember it being better. Very well seasoned but it came out a little colder than I would have liked - as if it had been sitting for a while before the waiter noticed it should be taken to our table. We were seated quickly but the service overall was a bit slow - and the place didn‚Äôt seem particularly busy, so not sure why that was. Got my drink before the food and I was hoping for a refill but didn‚Äôt get one until just before we boxed our food up. We got their margherita and the Don (meat lovers). Both were good I just remember it being better last time I was here. Perhaps just an off night. The atmosphere was family friendly and a nice place to have some pizza.",4
8,Grimaldi's Pizzeria,"1 Front St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.2,Esther Almo,"Pizza of course was delicious. But the lemon vinaigrette and arugula salad was a pleasant and delicious surprise.  So good. We ordered a second one. And the cheese cake was so light, fluffy and creamy.",5
9,Grimaldi's Pizzeria,"1 Front St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.2,Clara Novem,"Line out the door! But very quickly accommodated. Unfortunately we got some dirty silverware with our table. The manager was very on top of everything and was present and interactive. Food was quick. Shared an antipasto and a large Brooklyn Bridge pizza. The pizza was everything it should be ü§å
Had a chocolate cannoli and a traditional one. If you don't like too sweet, def go with the traditional. Overall love the place.",5
10,Grimaldi's Pizzeria,"1 Front St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.2,Priyanga CrewForShoots,Absolutely great pizza and local beer for the taste of Brooklyn. Good atmosphere with classical music. Must visit if you cross the Brooklyn Bridge. Not sure about parking etc. Very helpful staff. Single-use washroom so there can be a line.,5
11,Tutt Heights,"47 Hicks St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.5,Timothy R,"Run of the mill mediterranean restaurant plus pizza for the locals.

One person was  working the front section and a little overwhelmed. Nice enough guy, but it's too busy to keep up any service.

Try the Loomi, it's excellent!

Nothing stellar about the food or the presentation. The fresh pita was a nice addition, and the rice was good as well. The lamb was fresh enough, but a little overcooked and not seasoned as much as I'm used to when I'm in the Middle East. The flat wide skewer normally used for an Adana kebab was absent, so I got a round hotdog lamb stick. Fair enough, just different. The mixed salad had hardly any dressing, if any. At least it was fresh and diced small.

The mixed appetizer was a small portion and not worth the price to me. The onion chickpea side was a new one and not that appealing. I'm guessing that it is sumac on the pickled beats?

I'm being a little rough on this restaurant, but I expected better in NYC. Comparing it to every other Middle Eastern restaurant in the US only, I probably should give it 2.5 stars.

Would I return? No
Is it worth a stop? Meh...",3
12,Tutt Heights,"47 Hicks St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.5,Jennifer Oren,"A true gem, Tutt is a longtime favorite of our family. The green pitza is my absolute favorite - it it topped with cheese, fenugreek, scallions, and leeks - addictive! Their homemade pita is outstanding, as are all the meat (shawarma, merguez, wings), salads, and small plates (homemade hummus and labneh, to name a few).

They serve beer and wine, service is quick and friendly, and the inside is clean.",5

15,Tutt Heights,"47 Hicks St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.5,Evan Olivares,Honestly the best Mediterranean food I‚Äôve ever tried. The meat was so tender and full of tasty spices & the service was excellent. Everything was perfect. One dish can serve about two hungry people.,5
16,Cecconi's DUMBO,"55 Water St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.1,Linda L,"You come for the views and the scenery. First
Time here and last time. The food is overpriced and not a lot of options. The pasta was undercooked. The waiter was busy so I didn‚Äôt bother trying to get his attention. He came to refill out water twice. He didn‚Äôt ask how the food was. It was busy but thankfully we didn‚Äôt have to wait long. The biggest disappointment was the pizza. How can you mess up a margarita pizza. It taste bland. It was not tasty. We got two pasta. One was the pesto pasta, one was the meat pasta and last one was the children pasta. We got the calamari which was great. I wouldn‚Äôt come back again.",3
17,Cecconi's DUMBO,"55 Water St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.1,Nhi P,"Lovely restaurant with a great view of the bridge! We had to wait quite a while even though we‚Äôve booked a reservation at around 2 PM on a weekend, but the staffs were nice about it. The portions, however, are quite small and underwhelming. I suppose the price tag is very much for the great location and interior.",4
18,Cecconi's DUMBO,"55 Water St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.1,Malik Ahmad,"Great atmosphere, service was little slow for us but overall it was busy so probably not their fault. A bit pricey but food was flavorful. I had Chicken paillard with cherry tomatoes/ arugula, & it was great. Bar service was great, made me my favorite mocktail mojito.",4
19,Cecconi's DUMBO,"55 Water St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.1,Svitlana Anderson,Amazing spot with beautiful view of the Manhatten Bridge. The food and drinks were extremely delicious. The waiter was friendly. We had a perfect romantic night out with my boyfriend. Highly recommend.,5
20,Cecconi's DUMBO,"55 Water St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.1,Richard Izrael,"After a short 30 minute wait at the bar, we had a nice a view outside on the Brooklyn bridge. However, the waiter served us an Evian water in a completely dusty glass and when asked to change it didn‚Äôt bring a new bottle and charged full. Also the table was very dusty. It is really overpriced for the quality of food, it is your regular pizza and salad was very lacking.",3
21,The River Caf√©,"1 Water St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.4,William Thomas (Photography),"We had the amazing pleasure of photographing a wedding here last March. It was intimate, warm, cozy, and just the perfect space for close friends and family to gather and celebrate the couple. The restaurant's gardens were impeccable even in the winter, and if you know the neighborhood like us, there are truly so many amazing options for creative photography. We cannot wait to come back and photograph more amazing events here.",5
22,The River Caf√©,"1 Water St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.4,Damien Price,"With a reputation that far proceeds it, I can certainly say that it delivers on expectations. Service and quality of food are top-notch. In addition, this restaurant has an absolutely beautiful view of the Hudson River. Pricing is high as expected. However, this is a lovely place for special occasions.",5
23,The River Caf√©,"1 Water St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.4,Raven Newton,So romantic and the service is always ready to handle your every need. Cocktails went down so smooth and the chef is kind enough to give complimentary dishes to enhance the experience. This was a celebration of my love‚Äôs birthday and definitely will be one to remember. Highly recommend sunset reservations and do them in advance as they book quickly.,5
24,The River Caf√©,"1 Water St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.4,Isis Chestnut,"Let's talk about finding this place. The front door is not facing a street, you drive into like a enchanted garden and the valet guys are awaiting your arrival. They have a coat check once you are inside and the inside is very cozy. Get to the table and I was presented with a stool for my purse. We had the view of the water, just makes it a true romantic date. Professionalism is a understatement, just phenomenal service from each and every person. The plates are small but very unique with great flavor. I can't remember my cocktail, I had 3 of them so I'll just leave that there. This is not a leggings and sweats spot, they warn you to please abide by their dress code. Please experience this, is was worth it.",5
25,The River Caf√©,"1 Water St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.4,Shukhrat Maks,"Expensive but worth the price for the high-end food classy service and atmosphere.  Valet parking included, prefixed menu with variety of options. The view of the bridge is nice if you get the window table, the dessert of the Brooklyn Bridge is a great one to get.",5
26,Seamore‚Äôs,"66 Water St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.3,Vlad Lesun,"Not bad restaurant in this area. There weren't many people in there so the waiter paid a lot of attention to us(in a good way). The food is not great, but good.
Scallops was really delicious. And their fish tacos was nice.",5
27,Seamore‚Äôs,"66 Water St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.3,Ghislain Plourde,"This Seafood restaurant is amazing.
The best scallops I ever had, and for a seafood restaurant I was expecting the dessert to be ordinary, but to my surprise it was delicious!!!

Also, i'm not an oyster fan but my wife said they were very good.

The scallops, oysters and churros ice cream sandwich is what I recommend!!

The service was also great!

Really worth it if you are in New York and what seafood!",5
28,Seamore‚Äôs,"66 Water St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.3,L Jean Camp,"The seafood was excellent and there were vegetarian options.
The reason the service has five stars despite being a bit spotty is the dessert. It was a churro ice cream sandwich. The churros were fresh deep fried, as a spiral, with two layers of ice cream between. They melted down as we ate. Get two spoons. This had to be whisked straight from the kitchen immediately, and it clearly was.",5
29,Seamore‚Äôs,"66 Water St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.3,Jenn Plumb,"My sister and I were in NYC for our girls trip and decided to trek across the Brooklyn bridge and have dinner in Brooklyn.   We came across this charming restaurant.   Food was delicious and our server Scarlett was so friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  She made great recommendations and she did not disappoint.  Next time I‚Äôm in Brooklyn, I‚Äôll definitely be eating here.  The guacamole was amazing and the lobster roll was heavenly.",5
30,Seamore‚Äôs,"66 Water St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.3,Charlene Roberts,"Excellent choice for a quick bite. The food was excellent quality and delicious to my foodie pallet. Enjoyed bottomless brunch cocktails too.

The grits were excellent! The avacado toast was wow! And the biscuits were heavenly.",5
31,Noodle Pudding,"38 Henry St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.5,Tigershout,"Definitely worth the trip, although not a 5 star. As everyone noted, this is CASH ONLY. Before 10pm, nearest ATM is 5-10 mins, after 10pm it's 10 mins so do bring enough cash for a good tip.

We went without a booking at 9pm for 5 people. Indoors did have an excellent vibe but we were starving so were happy to sit in the outside covered section without waiting 40 mins. Even in December at 9 degrees (European) with the heater at the back it was definitely not even needed for jackets.

Front of house is amazing, so friendly and chatty. As we were outside, getting attention or staff became tricky but everyone was very nice when we did.

Despite it's reputation, we went for the garlic bread with homemade chilli oil, which is 100% a winner & still sad we didn't buy any. Do save some if you get pasta to mop up the juices as it went so well with the lasagne. The cacio e Pepe with asparagus & egg yolk went down very well, and the wine selection isn't outstanding but decent enough.

We skipped dessert but everything looked great. I'd 100% recommend this as a safe, delicious, and fun bet for a group dinner. Would definitely go back.",4
32,Noodle Pudding,"38 Henry St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.5,Susie Su,"Some of the best desserts I‚Äôve ever had, loved their tiramisu and chocolate espresso cake.

The entrees and appetizers were a bit lacking on their New Year‚Äôs Eve menu, I think they are known for their pastas so will come back to try their pastas in the future.

Cash only.",4
33,Noodle Pudding,"38 Henry St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.5,Javier Kohen,"I loved the mushroom pasta, and the ambiance. The garlic bread with spicy sauce was a great treat, at the same time crunchy and fluffy. The swordfish tasted really good, but it was a bit dry. The staff was friendly, but slow, very clearly overwhelmed by the number of customers.",5
34,Noodle Pudding,"38 Henry St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.5,Jackie Gordon Singing Chef,"I love a restaurant that is old school and completely consistent. That's hard to pull off. This is a very busy neighborhood joint that's like taking a trip back in time. A good trip back in time.

The waiter made us laugh when we asked about their cocktails. He said don't ask for anything that you couldn't have ordered in a bar 25 years ago.

The food is comforting and generous. The service is excellent.",4
35,Noodle Pudding,"38 Henry St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.5,Silvia,Very nice Italian place with good quality and options for food. There is no reservation and they only take cash. Everything that we order was tasty.,4
36,Juliana‚Äôs Pizza,"19 Old Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.6,Anja Nikolic,"One of my favourite experiences from NYC! I absolutely loved it here. The waiter was so nice and the service was done quickly!

Food was 10/10 - not yours truly Neapolitan pizza but very, VERY tasty US/Italian classic style pizza üçï!

Kudos to the hostess that helped me out with the phone charger and the waiter that had so much patience with the extremely needy guests next to my table - very professional!",5
37,Juliana‚Äôs Pizza,"19 Old Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.6,D Guo,"They have a long history, especially known for their thin crust pies. If you're going on the weekend, it's best to arrive about 15 minutes before opening to secure a seat. Alternatively, avoid peak hours.

In terms of taste, there may not be a significant difference compared to other thin crust pies in New York, but they are the OG that made this type of thin crust pie, a category of New York pizza, very famous. So, if you're looking to taste the legendary New York pizza made with water and dough from the Brooklyn, I recommend making a pilgrimage to this establishment.

Besides pizza, their meatballs and salads are also delicious, and the prices are reasonable.",5
38,Juliana‚Äôs Pizza,"19 Old Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.6,Amir Sorousheh,Small busy Pizzeria . First in first service with a long lineup outside. But it is really worth to spend some time to get a table. Very friendly staff. Simple but nice decoration. Open kitchen with coal fired oven. I got Pizza Margarita and added mushrooms. Really delicious. I will go there again and definitely recommend this place.,5
39,Juliana‚Äôs Pizza,"19 Old Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.6,Nakib,"Located within walking distance from Dumbo with a stunning view of the Manhattan Bridge, this pizza spot is a gem worth visiting. The Margherita pizza here is an absolute must-try! The crust was perfectly crispy, and the fresh ingredients made each bite delightful.

Although there was a line for dine-in, the takeout service was quick and efficient, making it convenient for those in a hurry. I highly recommend this place for anyone craving authentic and delicious pizza in a picturesque setting. A definite favorite for pizza lovers! Undoubtedly one of the best pizza spots in NYC.",5

19 Old Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201
I had a fantastic experience at Juliana's Pizza recently! Located right by the iconic Brooklyn Bridge, this pizzeria is steeped in history and has a vibrant atmosphere. The pizzas are thin and crispy, with a variety of delicious toppings. I personally loved the white pizza with prosciutto, but there's something for everyone on the menu.
Even though it was a Wednesday night, there was a bit of a wait to get in. But it was definitely worth it! The service was friendly and attentive, and the overall atmosphere was electric.
If you're looking for an authentic New York pizza experience, Juliana's is a must-visit. I highly recommend checking it out!",5
41,The Osprey,"60 Furman St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.1,Caitlin Wasilewsky,"Our recent brunch experience at The Osprey was incredibly disappointing. From the moment we walked in, the front of house staff, Rebecca, displayed shocking rudeness and lack of helpfulness. Despite being told we had to order at the bar regardless of where we sat, it was perplexing to see others outside (where we ended up sitting) being served at their tables.

To add to the confusion, while we had to fetch our own food from the bar, neighboring tables received table service. When we requested a glass change due to lipstick, Rebecca's indifferent attitude was disheartening. As an Australian myself, I expected more from an Australian cafe.

Overall, the food was mediocre at best, and coupled with the subpar service, the high prices were unjustified. I wouldn't recommend The Osprey to anyone based on this experience.",1
42,The Osprey,"60 Furman St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.1,Renee Lam-Whiteman,"The Osprey is located in The One Hotel Brooklyn. The restaurant was top notch. The food and service were wonderful. We ordered several things and ate family style which was great so we got to try several things on the menu. I highly recommend The Osprey. We ordered raw oysters, they were fresh and sweet. The beef skewers were tender and tasty. It was served with a table top grill. The scallops were cooked to perfection and were to die for!",5
43,The Osprey,"60 Furman St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.1,Melissa O'Connor,"We loved every bit of our dinner here! Each dish we ordered was delicious. The one thing that we disliked was the cocktail prices (they were great, but no cocktail should be over $20). The menu was also very vegetarian friendly. Will definitely consider coming back!",5
44,The Osprey,"60 Furman St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.1,Maor Cohen - Pickspace CEO,"I really liked it! It feels like you're outside but you are actually inside.

46,Time Out Market New York,"55 Water St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.5,Alejandro Ramia,"This place is awesome! They got all kinds of food from around the world. If you're going with a big group, everyone can get a different dish, and then you can all share in the middle. Just make sure to order by 7:30pm if you're going in the afternoon, because some of the spots close early. And definitely go to the rooftop for sunset!

A ad bit dark so for those who have trouble seeing in the dark might struggle. We went when the sun was already set so it was just the fairy lights but it was still very lovely.

Top service, great atmosphere, delicious cocktails, incredible food.

The place itself is really nice, we sat outside and the atmosphere was so pretty. The food was okay, definitely overpriced. I know NY prices are high but $20 for two little tacos is a little much. You‚Äôre definitely paying for the aesthetic. The worse part was the service. We came here on a Monday and it wasn‚Äôt busy, but somehow the food took FOREVER, two people in our party never got their food, they watched us eat the whole time because the waitress forgot to ring their food. (At the end they gave us the food we never received in containers to go for free, but when we got to the car one of the orders was completely wrong, it wasn‚Äôt even the food we ordered).
We were given an alcoholic drink after asking for a normal iced tea. Not only that, but when the check came we were charged for extra drinks we never ordered‚Ä¶ probably won‚Äôt be coming back here.",2

As soon as you walk in the bartender at the bar greets you with a friendly welcome. You‚Äôre seated faster than most places. The atmosphere is perfect for a date night. The lighting is not too bright and the music is not too loud so you can actually hear who you‚Äôre talking to. I had the linguine with fresh clams. The pasta was cooked to a tender texture. Personally, I prefer a little bit more flavor to my food so I had to sprinkle on some salt and pepper. The desserts are delicious and provide a nice ending to your meal.

Well here we go again, back at our favorite place celebrating my best friends brand new chapter in life - 30 years old. When we decided to go back we said we would get the same dishes we ordered last time - Salmon and Clam linguini because they were absolutely delicious.

Then I saw the Chicken Piccata and couldn't help myself, had to try something new ::insert mind blown GIF:: Little did I know the chicken picacata would turn into my new favorite dish here. The chicken was beautifully laid on a bed of greens, potatoes and a mouth watering lemon / caper sauce. That sauce was so good, not one drip of it was left behind. Only reason I didn't pick the plate up, put it to my face to lick the rest of the sauce is because I actually have some table manners. Lol

The clam linguini was just as good this time as it was the last. This place never lets me down. The service is good and chill. Great location just minutes away from the Dumbo water front.",5

61,Westville Dumbo,"81 Washington St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.5,Sila Gunn,"First time coming to Dumbo location, the service was slow. Waited for a bit to order. The server was all her alone for outdoor sitting.

The drinks and food came at the same time, which was not what I prefer for brunch.

They only have limited options for brunch. Which was another disappointment. I usually get pesto chicken salad. But they didn‚Äôt have it in the Dumbo location.

I got steak sandwich with fries, my boy friend got the hamburger. And we got Greek salad to share.

The salad was not fresh at all. The feta cheese was delicious. The dressing was very good. I hope it could be fresh, when it comes to greens in salad I prefer when it‚Äôs fully fresh ingredients.

The hamburger & sandwich didn‚Äôt really taste good. It was 5/10 to be honest. The fries were too oily for us. The taste of oil makes me really uncomfortable after ate.

Cocktails was not good as it used to be as the other location offers more option and more fresh ingredients. Not sure if we‚Äôll visit again.",3
62,Westville Dumbo,"81 Washington St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.5,Carly Pisarri,"Went on a Sunday w a friend for brunch. It was definitely an off day for them. Our server got almost everything wrong. Forgot salmon on the salmon Benedict, forgot the salad w my burger, I‚Äôm pretty sure I ate regular/non vegan cheese I ordered and over charged us for the drinks and the sides. We had to ask three separate times for our waiter to remove the false charges and he gave us a pretty hard time abt everything. They got both our orders wrong and over charged us twice - they should have given some concession and recognized their faulty service but didn‚Äôt. Zero effort to recognize their mistakes which I was surprised by.

Beautiful space and great location but I would not go back.",2

75,bar56,"53 Water St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",4.9,Sadi,"Allow me to articulate a meticulously considered assessment of my dining experience at Bar 56, a venue exuding sophistication and meticulous design. Every facet, from the meticulously planned silverware to the elegantly crafted glasses, resonates with a meticulous investment of time and effort. The atmosphere exudes a palpable aura of class, making it an impeccable choice for those seeking to dazzle a date.

Upon entering, the attention to detail becomes evident, as guests are welcomed at the door with a warm smile, and their coats are graciously attended to. The establishment boasts an impressive selection of 56 wines, complemented by a standby sommelier for those in need of guidance. The service, impeccably detail-oriented yet discreet enough not to disrupt conversations, attests to a refined dining experience. Crumbs vanish seamlessly, a testament to their attentiveness.

Regrettably, the zenith of elegance encountered a nadir in the realm of cuisine. Opting for Potato Croquettes revealed a lack of seasoning, the only salvation being a modest application of salt. The Hiramasa Crudo, though impeccably fresh, proved too piscine for my palate, with the blood orange standing as the sole memorable note. The Grilled Lamb Neck, despite achieving culinary precision, left a void in flavor, a genuine letdown. However, salvation arrived in the form of the Farfalle Argentine Red Prawn, Puttanesca, a symphony of flavors harmonizing with flawlessly cooked prawns, redeeming the evening's culinary journey.",3

For brunch I love the French toast and the Egg Torta,and the fried chicken sandwich is delicious too.  I love the unique dinners, different types of game like duck and elk chops and other dishes you don‚Äôt see anywhere else.

They are famous for their game dishes and my antelope steak with potato gratin was 10/10! The red snapper was also great - nicely flaky and well seasoned.
Though it is definitely a place to try all those exotic meats like elk chops, bison, boar end even a turtle soup.
They have great wine selection. I was impressed you can get a glass of 1970 Medoc Bordeaux for $25 only - in most places you'd have to splurge for a bottle.
The grilled vegetables with polenta and mushrooms salad were perfect apps and also above expectations.
Try not to get stuffed on the fluffy bread in the very beginning!
The ambiance is very casual, though it could easily be a place for a special occasion. They are pretty full every day,  so definitely make a reservation at least 3-4 days in advance.",5

Now, the pulled pork with plantain was just okay, nothing to write home about. But honestly, with everything else being so good, it's easy to overlook.

The only downside? The wait. I waited for an hour before getting the food. Not too bad if you grab a drink from the bars nearby.

Overall, it was a solid experience. I'm not sure if I'd wait in line again, but those flavors are definitely tempting me to come back for more.",4

Think they played with the scale when I was getting my food since when two ribs full of bone and fat cost 130 dollars? I went there with my brothers yesterday. I think $129.50 for 2 ribs is a bit too much specially how much fat they had no flavor and over cooked. It felt like the meat had no feature to it would just break down as you‚Äôd chew. I‚Äôm the receipt the lady marked it down as three ribs

Food placement wasn‚Äôt that great as soon as I picked it up a whole cut up sausage fell off I told them it was okay I didn‚Äôt mind it but they were nice enough to bring another one to our table. I‚Äôm happy for that. Sausages were good.

The lady at the register seemed to have an attitude towards my brother who is light skin and ordered before me then changed it when he left a good tip, and then me but nicer to me still not a good attitude treated me different because I look white to be frank but not nice until yet until she saw the tip also and he told me noticed she did the same thing to him. So I‚Äôm not just seeing and thinking things. My brothers a gun teacher and we met up after work to go there.  We all young looking professionals not sure what her deal was.

They should have taste samples for people to taste and not let people taste all the food after they already ordered while orders are waiting in line.

The chicharr√≥n was good. It had a nice Smokey flavor and crispy could be more crispy not bad.

The sausages were delicious

I got the ribs because the guy Recomended them saying they were really good turns out they weren‚Äôt I found out the hard way they looked like then were sitting there on the wood board for a while cold and meat was mushy

15 dollars for a small cup of rice? These people are out of their minds it‚Äôs a money grab

Mac and cheese was good but not enough Mc and cheese to charge 10 dollars for that was like a 5-6 dollar portion

As a Dominican myself and ‚ÄúDominican inspired bbq‚Äù the food has no taste no flavor no Dominican seasoning.  Cool concept not cheap food doesn‚Äôt live up to the expectations üëéüèºü´°",1

The Food: I went with the Nashville Hot Chicken Biscuit Sandwich Combo with a side of Mac N Cheese. I can tell you, from the plates I see being served to others, you will be in a food coma right after the meal! The fried chicken itself was cooked to perfection. Nice layer of crunchy skin, and tender meat that just break apart so easily. The meat was also very juicy and flavorful.  They had the Nashville hot seasoning down to a T. The Mac N Cheese was also a star player here. The pasta cooked well and the cheese combined together made it perfect. Right amount of gooey cheese that made every bite worth it.

The Service: Service was great! Ordered at the kiosk and waited for my order. Wasn't long before I was called to pick up mine for to go. Staff are nice and friendly as well.

The Atmosphere: Since it was a food stall, can't speak too much on it's own atmosphere. But they do have a bar area in front of their kitchen for you to eat. Not that much seating, so you may need to find another spot up or downstairs.

Overall, 5/5. Chicken cooked perfectly with incredible flavor. I'd highly giving this place a try.",5

It is cash only, but they have an ATM machine by the bathroom. We didn‚Äôt have enough cash and I don‚Äôt carry around a debit card, but when we got up to leave, they said they could process a card transaction for a 4% fee. I‚Äôm glad they let us do that as the pizza was really good!",5

Cons: the biggest con was the service. Both the hostess and our server were very rude, and acted like small requests (like asking for a straw) were very inconvenient. She left our table after serving drinks and we had to ask another waitress to get her after about 20 minutes so we could order our food.

Also, two of us ordered the tomato watermelon salad, which only has four ingredients. Two ingredients (basil and shiso) were missing when it arrived. After our waitress came back 5 minutes later, I had to ask about the other ingredients (I thought maybe they had run out and figured they could get away with not telling us?), and she seemed bothered but took our plates back to the kitchen and came back 10 minutes later with the correct full dish.

121,Mr Taka,"55 Water St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",2.9,LIEM,Had the Spicy Black Garlic Tonkatsu Ramen and Pork Belly Bao. Was very good. Crowded on. Sunday afternoon so went to better seating on the roof outside. The kitchen area is open to see the cooks so nothing is hidden. Very good experience and enjoyed the food. Highly recommend üëçüèº‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,5
122,Mr Taka,"55 Water St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",2.9,Vance Lor,"Food - Tonkotsu ramen was pretty bland. Noodles were sticking together so they weren‚Äôt fresh or prepared properly. Egg was old and not fresh and the colorization gives it away. The meat was old and has no seasoning to it.

Service - Poor, no enthusiasm and no communication in the kitchen! Seems like everyone didn‚Äôt want to be there which means the food was made with no love.

Atmosphere - Sad, again, looks clean but no communication or enthusiasm between the workers. Some had earphones in so there was no attentiveness to the food making process.

Overall, don‚Äôt recommend. Get something else. First look for the atmosphere, then the service, then the food.",1

124,Mr Taka,"55 Water St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA",2.9,Elliott Castillo,"The tonkatsu ramen was the blandest ramen ever.  A beautiful looking ramen with no taste whatsoever- they literally forgot to add salt and seasoning. Saddest tasting ramen I've had, and like others have mentioned this has been going on for a while. Stay away from the ramen is my suggestion, or ask for a sample.",1

We're not vegan but we were intrigued by the concept, menu and ingredients used, so we decided to give it a try.

We had the kung pao Brussels sprouts, the Dan Dan noodles, and the dumplings.

The dumplings did not impress us that much, but the other 2 dishes were stellar, I could eat those Brussels sprouts all the time and will definitely try to recreate them at home (I live in Canada, a bit too far to come often!)

So far this has been the best food we've had during our stay in South Beach.

Called the pier 6 location to complain to a manager and she suggests I travel further to her shop where they have it. Ridiculous. Timeout is a top Brooklyn tourist destination, there is no reason they should be advertising GF pizza and yet never serving it. If they in fact do ‚Äúrun out‚Äù they should mark it off of the menus posted (see pic) so people dont wait in line (long wait time because they are slow). They should also post it on all social media so people dont travel to them.

We started with the 8-piece serving size of wings and then the butter clams. The wings were perfect in texture and flavor; the sweet touch of the sauce worked out pretty well. The clams were delicious, too; the side of bread was fresh and warm.

For the mains, I did the pork chops, also with a touch of sweetness that made me like them a lot‚Äîa good portion size.

My partner got the dry pork noodles, and I got to try a bit of that too; it was good and a big portion.

It was a great experience overall. It seems they were a bit understaffed today, but the workers were highly diligent and on top of their game, so everything worked out fine.",5

There usually is a wait when the market is packed, so try to make a reservation if you can. They have about 2 dozen tables inside with larger tables in the back. Their menu isn't huge but they do things well here. The pho broth is amazing and the wings are delicious, although overpriced for the portion size you get. The rest of the food have good portions though for the price. The service is pretty bad, 3 of the 4 employees we interacted with were flat out rude or condescending. Even at the end when we just paid the bill and got the receipt, in less than a minute a busser came up and said ""we need this table so you guys are gonna need to leave now."" As we left, he stood in the aisle we needed to walk through to get out as well, so just overall terrible staff.

The deviled eggs for example though it was delicious, was $14 and just one egg cut in half. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs because of the bacalao topping? But it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs imported fresh uni or anything. $7 for half a boiled egg with fish topping, we both laughed when they served us the plate.  $24 Pasta was‚Ä¶good, just kinda tiny also.
