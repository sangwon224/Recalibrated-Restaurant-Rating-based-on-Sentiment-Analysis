Server more than helpful and we can watch Liverpool game there on Sunday! Good selection of beers (husband expert level beer taster having had his own bar) had chicken wings and a lovely conversation with a library expert local who I assume is a regular … nice speaking to a New Yorker about all things American and British!

We had been looking for a nice local bar and this was definitely one we were pleased to go in!",5
2,Amsterdam Ale House,"340 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10024, USA",4.3,dave I,"4/13/24 first time here. Cool bar vibe. Interesting beers on tap.
We had the pretzel 'filled with jalapeno cheese' but there was No hint of jalapeno.
So it's just cheese filled, good but smaller than we expected. Not like your traditional large hot pretzel.
We had the turkey Ruben, which was good.
Friendly service.
Trendy crowd-",4

4,Amsterdam Ale House,"340 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10024, USA",4.3,CA Hyde,"Stopped by before a show at The Beacon. Good beer selection. Decided to share the loaded nachos with pulled pork, it was a large portion, and very tasty. Not so with the Buffalo cauliflower wings. The taste was OK, but the breading was soggy, mushy. They should be fried til nice and crispy, then tossed in sauce right before serving. They tasted more like a bad frozen meal from a store and microwaved. The server was great and was able to take it off our bill.",4
5,Amsterdam Ale House,"340 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10024, USA",4.3,Steve Dempsey,"Not the first time here and it's a good local neighborhood bar. They have a ton of outdoor seating, in front, on the side and a large curb side shelter as well.

Lots of craft beer on tap and full menu. Service was prompt, hostess seated us outside right away and server was right over. They brought a water dish for my dog. I did feel the mozzarella sticks were pretty skinny but I guess those are the times.

Overall great place for a brew and food.",4

7,Little Italy Pizza,"2047 Broadway, New York, NY 10023, USA",3.9,Thomas Mauriello,"Narrow little local pizzaria serving delicious crispy pizza , quick register service and 15 to 20 small tables you can push around for small groups of up to 7 or so people.

Garlic knots are garlicky, pizza hot and crispy. A regular slice is very thin with a lot of flop and a medium amount of oil drip. Other slices like Sicilian and Grandma look good too.",5

16,Emerald Inn,"250 W 72nd St, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.2,Nick Felker,"I came here one night for some dinner. I heard their burger was very good. It's good, with some pickles adding to the flavor, but not my favorite in the city. The service was great, with a friendly bartender. The atmosphere was very laid back, akin to an Irish pub, with good vibes.",4
17,Emerald Inn,"250 W 72nd St, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.2,A R,"Emerald Inn is my favorite Irish Pub on the Upper West Side. We have been visiting here since they were in their first location on Columbus Avenue. It has now been over 10 years since they moved to the current location. The food has always been solid, and the service at the bar has never been anything short of fantastic! I couldn't recommend Emerald Inn highly enough if you're looking for a nice Irish Pub on the UWS.",5
18,Emerald Inn,"250 W 72nd St, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.2,Sterling Archer,"I came in, had a Guinness, and the staff let me sit quietly and enjoy my beer in peace. No fuss, nice quiet drink during the day. Very enjoyable.",5

The scene at the pool table was really nice, with short wait times, skilled players who were pleasant and mature, and good available cues.

This place is a lovely oasis of calm in a crowded city.",5
22,Dark Bullet Sake & Oyster Bar,"154 W 72nd St, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.5,Matthew Gantz,"Dark Bullet Sake & Oyster Bar is a very unique place for those with varied tastes. It's a bar, and they have a pool table in the back, and sports on TVs. It was a bit odd being able to watch tennis at 10pm on a Saturday night, but I appreciated it. The atmosphere is a bit off to me - it feels like everything is overly sanitized (might just be the harsh white lighting in some areas). But overall it was a decent place for a drink and chatting with friends.",4
23,Dark Bullet Sake & Oyster Bar,"154 W 72nd St, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.5,CCG G,A wonderful secret gem for fantastic Japanese food. Perfect place for a date night or friends group hangout. The drink menu (various sakes and beers and a decent selection of cocktails) was well priced. The ambiance is like a dive bar but don’t let that fool you! The Japanese food served is some of the best in Manhattan. The gyu donburi (angus beef rice bowl) was honestly incredible. The oysters were fresh and delicious. The garlic rock shrimp was also very delicious.,5

The oysters were super fresh and my martini was absolutely perfect.I didn't catch the name of my servers but they were super cool and friendly. I felt like a regular and that is very special.

33,Simply Noodles,"267 Amsterdam Ave Unit 1, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.6,Carol,"Attention and friendly service. Spicy mala rice noodle soup is simply so delicious. The soup base was well seasoned with fresh sliced beef, lettuce 🥬, wood ears mushroom, sweet corns, tofu and half of egg cooked in perfection.

A great spot for a quick bite and dishes are in very generous portions and very well priced considering the location.",5
34,Simply Noodles,"267 Amsterdam Ave Unit 1, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.6,Marco R. Paiz,"The food at Simply Noodle was delicious, each dish bursting with flavor and freshness. However, the service fell short. Midway through our meal, we were politely asked to vacate our table because it was needed for other patrons. This was off-putting as we were still enjoying our food and didn't expect to be rushed in that manner. A wonderful culinary experience marred by subpar customer service handling.",4
35,Simply Noodles,"267 Amsterdam Ave Unit 1, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.6,Ni'shaun Dow,I like this small place. It's nice if you want to get a meal by yourself or with a party of three. I definitely recommend the spicy miso ramen (I got mine with extra chili oil cuz I like spice) the texture of the noodles is perfect and feels good when I slurp them.,5
36,Simply Noodles,"267 Amsterdam Ave Unit 1, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.6,Julia Ramos,"The noodles are good, and the food IS good! HOWEVER they make you feel like you need to leave. The atmosphere just isn’t comfortable and i didn’t feel welcomed. My whole dining experience felt rushed and I felt eyes on me the whole time… The real kicker was when they brought the chicken wings and they were pink. they handed the bill right after n we left…. not a good experience at all.",1
37,Thai 72,"128 W 72nd St, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.4,MAJ PC,"What a great spot for freshly made delicious Thai food! We stopped in for dinner before a show nearby and can't say enough about this restaurant. Staff were happy to seat us without a reservation (it was early and not soon after we sat the place was buzzing with energy).
We stuck to the classics this time and weren't disappointed, each bite was umami filled perfection!
The staff are neatly dressed, polite and friendly, they checked-in occasionally to make we were happy.
Make sure to checkout the cocktail list, my husband (hard spirits only guy) was very happy and a few of the delicious cocktails.
We're definitely planning on returning to try some of duck dishes and other specialties.
Great hidden gem for Thai food!",5
38,Thai 72,"128 W 72nd St, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.4,Mansi Arora,"Had a great time at Thai 72 - what a find!  We had their delicious five star dumplings and a refreshing lychee Thai iced tea. The masaman curry was rich and flavorful and the roti with it was crispy. The phad khing ginger was initially too salty, but our server quickly rectified this with a replacement. The ambience was inviting, and the service, swift. Being able to make a same-day reservation added to the convenience. Overall, great food and service made our visit memorable.",4

The waiters are very attentive without doing too much, the price is decent and the food is so good. The atmosphere is very nice and relaxed. I usually ordered the cashew dish with steak to-go, but now I dined in and got drunken noodles. It was delicious. Thanks guys",5
40,Thai 72,"128 W 72nd St, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.4,Laura Chevalier,"One of the better pad thais I've had in the city, and very efficient service. The fried ice cream was delicious too, though the ice cream was a bit too frozen when served so it was hard to scoop into.

Overall I'd recommend!",5

The host Jill made me feel welcome and special. I was able to watch the Mets and basketball at the same time. The place was totally packed, yet my waitress brought me a taste of an amazing ipa and the best wings in NYC. Stephanie and Chloe never let my beer go empty. Amazing experience in every way. Highly recommended.",5
43,Blondies Sports,"212 W 79th St, New York, NY 10024, USA",4.3,Lauren Cover,"Definitely a divey scene, but came in to watch a basketball game and there was a good crowd. Plus, if you are in search of the perfect Buffalo wings, I highly recommend this place. They were crispy without being dry, generously sauced, and great flavor wing sauce. 10/10 would come back for more",5
44,Blondies Sports,"212 W 79th St, New York, NY 10024, USA",4.3,Tomas Williams,I had the driest wing ever. They fried them for too long. I barely taste the skin. It tasted dry almost burnt. It’s sad that you eat it and that they tell you it’s because I picked them as mild. Too dry wings 😩😩,3

46,Blondies Sports,"212 W 79th St, New York, NY 10024, USA",4.3,Mark Bacon,"I come in often with my roommates, and Denny and Jill are nothing but excellent every time.

There was once an issue with our bill and they remedied it immediately and with a smile.

The service here is unmatched, every time we come in we have an excellent experience.   From wait times to staff demeanor, to food quality everything is genuinely top tier. Atmosphere is fun, especially trivia on Friday nights!

The wings are absolutely stellar, every flavor slaps - without fail - and the onion rings are excellent!  The philly cheesesteak is a pass but the fries that come with it are also out of this world.

You would be remiss not to try this local spot!",5
47,Hummus Place,"305 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.6,Tammy Augustin,It’s really good but I wish they gave me more corn tortilla cus I have a bowl of hummus with nothing to eat it with and the green sauce is really good.,5
48,Hummus Place,"305 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.6,Maddy Aks,"This place was a random pick for dinner and was disappointed when there was no meat on the menu.

Surprisingly all the dishes were delicious and we just ordered more and more.

Tried Eggplant shakshuka for the first time and it was good and it is similar to Indian eggplant curry with eggs.

Even though their fresh juice seems pricey, it’s totally worth trying.",5
49,Hummus Place,"305 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.6,Bhakti Dalvi,"Great place with good options. Went in for a Sunday brunch. Got an eggplant shakshuka which tasted great.

The falafel was also delicious with a lot sauce. I'm not usually a fan of it, but this one made we want to have more. It was a great find for us since just found it off Google Maps as we were looking for a place for Hummus. We're so happy to have found the Hummus Place. One of the highlight or our trip. Thanks to the staff for the friendly service!",5
52,Salumeria Rosi,"283 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.5,Nunzio Lupo,"We’ve typically loved this place. Last night was not their best night. The prosciutto puffs were cold in the center, the ice tea was undrinkable, the peaches and burrata had four measly slices a tiny little peach, and the waiter urged us to split the large cotoletta instead of the small, which was enough to easily feed four. The leftovers (pictured) weighed 1.1 pounds. We love this place and want it to succeed, but they need to refocus. We’ll try again before writing it off. Fingers crossed.",3
53,Salumeria Rosi,"283 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.5,Isaac Smith,"Excellent lasagna, and decent wine by the glass. Our server was very helpful with wine suggestions, and was decently attentive.

We ate in the enclosed parklet, however a homeless person entered during our meal, and asked every dining patron for money before another member of the service staff arrived to guide the man out of the dining area.",5

61,Chirping Chicken,"355 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10024, USA",4.3,ML SMITH,"When I lived in the city, I would go here often.  I drove by today, and I just had to stop.  The restaurant is clean, bright, and relatively good seating.  For what you pay you, get a ton of food for the price.  Very selective menu with so much to choose from.  Outdoor parking is not ideal, so I recommend being in the neighborhood or ordering ahead and picking it up yourself.

Overall, great place because you get a lot of food for the price you pay",4
62,Playa Betty’s,"320 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.3,Justin Pontier,"I've always had a soft spot for Playa Betty's – it's practically an institution on the Upper West Side. Every time I return, I'm pleasantly surprised by their ability to keep things fresh and exciting on the menu. Their latest addition, the brunch menu, is no exception. It's a true smorgasbord with options catering to all tastes, and each dish is a delightful fusion of beachy flavors.

For the health-conscious, the breakfast burrito bowl stands out as a nutritious yet satisfying choice. On the flip side, the French toast is a sinful indulgence that is worth every bite. One thing not to miss is their customizable guacamole; where they bring you a tray full of goodies to allow you to tailor the guac to your exact preferences.

Stepping into Playa Betty's for brunch feels like a mini getaway to the sunny shores of California. Highlights include their inventive twist on chicken and waffles with the fried chicken and churros, a refreshing cactus mimosa, and, of course, their stellar taco selection.

We tried the lemongrass chicken, it was a nice presentation and the chicken is so flavorful. The Chilean Sea Bass in Aromatic Coconut Milk is also very good. A divine creation of pan-roasted sea bass, bunashimeji mushrooms, and asparagus served with a luscious coconut bisque. I was also blown away by golden puff, It was perfectly seasoned, this spot offers a perfect blend of ambience and cuisine for a relaxed yet delightful evening.

The food here deserves all the praise it can get. Each dish is crafted with care, showcasing a blend of flavors that are both bold and delicate. The attention to detail is evident, and it elevates the dining experience to a whole new level.

Service was friendly and well thought out, adding to the overall enjoyable experience. It’s also worth noting the inclusivity with all gender restrooms, though keep in mind there’s no wifi available.

Their all-beef hot dog franks are high quality and flavorful, with the signature snappiness and crispness of a good New York hot dog. I ordered the Recession Special (2 hot dogs + a drink for $6.45) and also topped my hot dogs with chile, cheese, onions, and relish! For drinks, I really enjoyed their papaya juice, which they make in-house from scratch. Overall, it’s a great deal if you’re looking for a quick lunch or afternoon snack in the city.",5
99,Gray's Papaya,"2090 Broadway, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.2,Graeme John,"“The best hotdogs in New York”

After spending time researching where to get a hot dog in New York it came down to Grays Papaya and Bilies Hotdog Cart. I chose here as this was a little closer, and I’m sure glad I chose it.

The hot dogs were delicious with loads of flavour and the papaya drink a was nice and  cold and lovely sweet flavour.

I got the Addicted which is 3 hot dogs and a large drink for about $10 which I thought was good value. I enjoyed it so much I got another one straight after.

Taste: the hotdog was grilled perfectly and the beans and cheese was the perfect combination for the flavour hit. The papaya flavoured drink is sweet and maybe not for everyone.

Service: The service was quick and friendly.

Staff: Very friendly and helpful.

Price: Well priced

Value: Great

Cleanliness: It was very clean behind the counter and inside looked clean too.

Location: We stayed downtown so it took us quite a while to get up to the store which is solidly uptown. There’s probably an easier way to get there (train/bus) but I thought the location is good as it’s not near Times Square or any ridiculously busy spot.

The wait: I waited less than 5 minutes for my first serving and less than 2 minutes when I ordered again.  This was around 2pm. I am sure it’s a lot busier at lunchtime.

Would I go back: Absolutely
Would I recommend going: If you want a hot dog in New York City this is the place to go!!!",5

Can I ask for two things?
The middle-aged ladies who serve us , please little faster and kinder. I felt a little uncomfortable because she seemed so blunt.

And I went with my mom, so was it necessary to assign a seat right in front of the restroom ? On a tiring day, I'm sensitive so if I crowd around Asians and make them sit in the corner, isn't this racism? I thought. I was like that yesterday.

And I know lots of places are doing this now, but it still is not right! Especially for pizza, where the profit margin is one of the largest in the food industry.  $4 for a slice isn't enough? They have to have an extra 3%. Last time I'll go here.",3
134,Made in New York Pizza,"271 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.4,C N,The square pizzas are sooooo good and crispy. The margarita pizza was ok. I wished I had tried the original slice and the mushroom. It looked really good. There was two other customers that were eating and went to order more.  The a/c w felt really good. The place was really clean and felt good to eat in. I will definitely come back to eat more!,5

If you’re lucky enough to reserve one of the 12 or so limited seats, all of which are at the omakase bar, you’re in for a real treat. Witnessing the artful, intricate  knife skills and extreme attention to detail of the sushi chef was mesmerizing.  Every single piece of the 12 course tasting was perfect!  Each bite truly did capture that elusive and highly desirable perfect balance of sweet, sour, saltiness, bitterness and savoriness.  The preparation seemed simplistic, but the beauty was in the complexity of flavor the chef was able to coax out of the fresh, delicate fish.  I would definitely go back!",5

I had a jack and ginger as a drink and the soda was flat. The Moscato I had was everything, I drunk 3 of those. The atmosphere was blah it was too dark .

I LOVE the mac n cheese and would totally buy it again! I forgot how much I pay, it was around $10 for this combo. Really great value for money considering the location.

I had been following Charles Pan Fried Chicken on IG, and I wanted to make sure we were able to enjoy this experience!

We had been shopping and dropped our bags off on our room and hopped on the Subway at 42nd St and took it out to Central Park West and 72nd. We followed 72nd about 3 blocks and went in!

It's a VERY small location (1 of 4; Flagship in Harlem; Another one at 125th; this one on 72nd and another on the upper East side).  There were 3 chairs at a counter and 4 of us. So, 3 of us sat in the chairs and 1 in the window pane opening.  We all ordered the same thing (3 piece chicken, 2 sides, corn bread, and a drink); this totaled about $22, including tax. I had black-eyed peas and collards  as my sides; two of my friends had okra/white rice and green beans, and the other had mac and cheese and collards.

The food was delicious and the portions generous! I took it down a star, as I really wish the were a couple more chairs/tables. We ate and had plenty left over to snack on as we packed to return home!

I highly recommend if you are in the city!",5

The crust is definitely foccacia-like, well charred while still being soft inside.   I got a funghi slice and an eggplant parmigiana slice.   My son got a buffalo chicken ranch and a pepperoni, and my husband got a Calabrese and a pepperoni.  There was no line at around 6:30 which was great, though they were clearly doing business.  Tables inside were about half taken.  It was very warm inside so we opted for the nice ""al fresco"" option they offer outside.  Pizza was reheated quickly, cut into pieces and promptly served to our table.  That said, although the crust was perfectly cooked - most of the toppings were disappointing.   Not ""bad"" pizza- but definitely not the finest NY has to offer.  Would I come back?  Sure.  Will it be a priority?   Nah.  If you're looking for decent pizza, stop by.   If you're looking for traditional NY pizza, keep looking.",3

They are an upscale Indian restaurant in the upper west side serving the most delicious Indian food I’ve ever had!

The ambiance is absolutely beautiful & transports you to a place of beauty & culture. Literally every corner of this place is a vibe 🥰

The cocktails are crafted with the essence of their origin & the food that takes you to Punjab. Not only does each dish taste absolutely delicious with tantalizing flavors, it’s presented so beautifully making it picture perfect 😍

From the lamb chops to the bone marrow Polau to the butter chicken, there’s something here for everyone that’s a must!

173,Kebab aur Sharab,"247 W 72nd St, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.2,Deb Lin,"This was a hard one to rate. I wish there was a separate rating for value. The service here was great, and the flavor of the food was quite good; but not enough to justify the cost. We ordered the fish curry ($36), butter chicken ($30), bone marrow ($39), and garlic naan ($8). Neither the fish curry nor the butter chicken came with rice, which was a shock, given the cost of these dishes. While most of the food was well prepared, the fish in the curry was actually quite overcooked, and the fish itself would not have been enough for a full meal, which made the fact that this dish did NOT come with rice all the more baffling.
The butter chicken would have been worth the $30 if it also came with rice. Would consider dining here again if the prices were either 20% lower, or also covered the tip at the current prices. But this is not a place that I could see people coming to regularly, unless you made enough that money was not an issue. Bottom line: the flavors are good; but the price is prohibitive.",2

Luckily the front lady was able to accommodate us, so awesome customer service! For appetizers we had the Aloo tikki chaat and paneer shashlik. The Aloo tikki was okay but the paneer shashlik was delicious & spicy. For the entree’s we had the Old Delhi Korma, Famous Butter Chicken, paired with Plain and Garlic naan, Malabar Bone Marrow Pulao, Chicken Biryani, paired with Classic Raita. I have to say the food was mediocre, nothing really struck out besides the plain naan. For dessert we had the chai cake which was good. They don’t serve chai. For drinks we had the mocktail mango chutney and a some recommendations but it was too sour. The aroma of the place is setup beautifully, customer service is great, clean bathrooms as well.

The interior is very small and intimate; there is no real decor to speak of. The service is well paced and it’s always a treat to watch food prepared in front of you. The only down side to this place is that it is BYOB. But on the plus side, there is no corkage fee. The fish is super fresh and the taste is great. I left still hungry, which wasn’t great.

Current pricing is $85 for 13 courses and $115 for 18 courses and you will leave satisfied and full as the quality of fish is outstanding especially for the price.

They are still waiting on their wine/beer license so the owner will give you free sake to not dampen the experience. Do the right thing, and tip as if it wasn’t free.

My only gripe, is we sat down at 8:45 and had 18 courses done by 9:50. Allow us a little pace and time to enjoy the incredible experience, please chef.",5

I got the Meatloaf & Mash, and wow. It was a hearty, good meal. The meat was moist, and the sauce paired so well with the dish. The string beans were also surprisingly tasty and garlicky, and I’m usually a string bean hater! Definitely recommend this dish to anyone who comes!

I ordered the Chilaquiles and it was the best in the USA HANDS DOWN! Amazing for first time comers to NY and essential for breakfast. Literal 100 out of 10 NO DOUBT.,5
194,Cafe Bee,"239 W 72nd St, New York, NY 10023, USA",3.7,Gabriel Agostini,"Cafe Bee is tucked inside Tea Magic and is mostly a takeout operation. I came here on a Saturday morning in search of a breakfast burrito, which had gotten quite a few shootouts and positive reviews on Google. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype. On the plus side, the burrito is large enough to share and the scrambled eggs inside of it are really tasty. On the downside, the chorizo isn't spicy and it comes with way too much of this sour cream like sauce. Overall, very average.",3
195,Cafe Bee,"239 W 72nd St, New York, NY 10023, USA",3.7,Laura Faith,"I’ve eaten here plenty of times and the food has been really good, like the pastas and the sandwiches, but this time I was shocked. My work ordered over 12 sandwiches and every sandwich was all vegetable and BARELY any meat. I couldn’t find hummus at all in that sandwich, and for the turkey sandwic, there were little tiny pieces of turkey. There was almost no tuna in that sandwich too. Disappointing.",2
196,Cafe Bee,"239 W 72nd St, New York, NY 10023, USA",3.7,Sonya Hu,"A lovely, hole-in-the-wall little cafe tucked in the corner of a boba shop with tasty food, including an impressively vast selection of vegan and vegetarian options. There's no seating inside the shop, but the Eleanor Roosevelt Memorial Park is just a few blocks away if you're alright with enjoying your food outside! The food was tasty, but a bit heavy and oversaturated with oil for my taste -- I opted for the egg white omelette, which didn't include any cheese (yay for me and my lactose intolerant friends), but did have a boat load of fresh veggies! It was incredibly tasty, and honestly way bigger than I was expecting, but did make me feel pretty greasy afterwards. The potatoes were even more saturated in oil and a bit oversalted, but still delicious. The meal also came with toast, which was just white bread toasted in what smelled like butter, so I didn't end up partaking, but the friend that I had gone to brunch with said that it was oddly chewy (potentially because it had to be wrapped in tin foil immediately after toasting).

She opted for one of their signature avocado toasts, which she adored -- it looks small, but it was incredibly filling, especially since they load on what seems like half or all of an avocado onto a single, frail piece of multigrain toast. The bread definitely couldn't hold up the heft of the avocado and salmon for long, so she ended up just eating her toast with a knife and fork, but it was still delicious nonetheless.

The cashier was really sweet and helpful, but it did take an incredibly long time for us to get our food; even though we were the only ones in the restaurant, we ended up waiting upwards of 25 minutes to get our to-go orders. Thankfully we weren't in too much of a rush, but I would definitely recommend opting for another spot if you're looking for a quick option.

Even so, Cafe Bee has a delightfully cute concept with great options for folks following a plant-based diet, and is definitely still on the top of my NYC breakfast recommendations!",3
197,Cafe Bee,"239 W 72nd St, New York, NY 10023, USA",3.7,Andrew David Greer,The food and drink was good but it's on the expensive side. The avocado toast plus egg and mocha latte cost $16 (not including tip). Kind of pricey considering how small the serving was. The one thing I will say is that the customer service was great. I brought my baby with me and one of the food runners literally ran out from the back to help me bring the carriage down the stairs. Thanks!,3
198,Cafe Bee,"239 W 72nd St, New York, NY 10023, USA",3.7,Eric Grant,"I've had good experiences in the past (their breakfast burrito is fantastic), but a recent order was terrible. It was runny and cold, probably due to the fact it took more than an hour to be delivered.",2

Nothing stands out in terms of flavor or presentation. For the avocado toast I will give 3 ⭐ for ""it's ok."" I won't review the granola and fruits because they are just things you can put together, no skills or artistry required.

I have to admit other dishes from other reviews look quite good (at least on photos), so perhaps I'll come here again -- just not for the avocado toast.

The vibe and service were nice overall. 4 ⭐.",3

Upon entering Coppola's West, we were immediately charmed by its cozy and inviting atmosphere. The restaurant exuded a rustic charm, creating a warm and welcoming ambiance for patrons to enjoy. Our attentive hostess seated us promptly, and our friendly server made us feel right at home.

Having recently indulged in dessert, we weren't as hungry as we were eager to explore the restaurant's offerings. However, we couldn't resist accompanying our meal with some delightful beverages. The menu boasted an impressive selection of wines, and we chose a red wine that paired perfectly with our chosen dishes, enhancing the flavors and creating a convivial dining experience.",5

We were greeted by the owner who was really friendly. We had accidentally reserved a table at the same restaurant which was located on the East side even though we came to the West side, but the owner arranged a table for us in 25 minutes and had us sit at the bar while we waited which was really nice. The dishes were huge, which came to us as a surprise, a great surprise since we were extremely hungry! Dishes were a tad too pricey, but worth the size and flavours. Only minus was that the service was a bit too hasty, I hardly had my last bite from my plate before it was taken away by the waiter. It was a bit stressful at some point since they were constantly jumping back and forth between different tables. But on the contrary, the service was one of the fastest I have experienced in New York, and very friendly and professional! I am definetely pinpointing this place on the map, and coming back again if I’m around the area!",5

But when you order more after the first round they put EVEN more rice in the roll than the filling. Twice the amount of rice. Horrible!

224,RedFarm,"2170 Broadway, New York, NY 10024, USA",4.4,Rickie L Jones,The food IS delicious but there are not many options. The 5 chili chicken is basically the same as the chicken dumpling.  It’s a bit Spicy for me but very good. Great waiters here and music Not Too Loud.,5
225,RedFarm,"2170 Broadway, New York, NY 10024, USA",4.4,William Poon,"We had a great time at RedFarm. We sat at the bar and our waitress/bartender was Aisha, who was extremely kind and hospitable. Not just to us, but every single person she interacted with.

She made great recommendations for our first time there. We got the lunar New Year dumplings, the Crispy Beef, Crispy Chicken, and Wild Rice Noodle with Duck.

The rice noodles and crispy beef hit home for us.

In terms of food, as a Cantonese person, it’s very familiar and is high quality and very good. You can get similar quality with higher quantity and lower prices in Chinatown but you won’t get the same vibes or drinks. You’re really paying for the vibes.

Vibes are super nice. Definitely seems like the place to be.

Would go back with some friends for an experience and maybe try the Peking Duck. The prices are on the higher end so heads up.",5

I love their asparagus and their snow peas, tender but crisp and salted correctly. I love their wings, meaty and stuffed to have multiple textures. I love their steak, oh my goodness that sweet salty fatty steak. I recommend basically the whole menu. My advice is to order with balance: sweet and salty, fatty and light. You'll love this place.

Also the staff is so cool, they made me feel like I was part of the neighborhood. Thanks for taking care of us.",5
228,RedFarm,"2170 Broadway, New York, NY 10024, USA",4.4,David Visoky,We liked it. Had a bunch of dumplings and various apps. Overall we liked it but it was so expensive for a Chinese lunch.

229,sweetgreen,"311 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.1,mandy,"Was excited to eat here since I've heard good things. It was my partner and I's first time so we were a bit indecisive, learning the ingredients and how the process worked. The woman serving us looked beyond annoyed. She was literally throwing our bowls down on the counter. Even my partner commented on her attitude to me privately. There was another woman who was smiling and greeting everyone - wish we got her instead. We pay and sit down where I realize our server got an ingredient wrong. The seating area was great, no blaring music, no cramped spaces. Overall the salad was very good, especially the chicken, but the pesto vinaigrette hardly has any flavor. Portion was generous so I'd hope they don't skimp anymore. I'd be willing to give sweetgreen a another chance but maybe earlier in the day or at a different location.",4

I did a create your own kale salad this time with cucumber, pickled onion, spicy broccoli, basil, miso glazed salmon, nori seasoning, crispy rice and spicy cashew dressing. Highly recommend it was 🤤 especially with the salmon, nori seasoning, basil and crispy rice.

Service was very slow later in the evening on a Tuesday night.

Had a couple of seafood pastas - the seafood part was great except the lobster and shrimp were clearly frozen but the red sauce was amazing! Better than anywhere.

Service was nice except the uniforms they wear are kind of ridiculous.  Wonderful atmosphere and a sense you could be in Queens or anywhere in New York.  Crowd was older and local.",5

My partner and I went on a rainy Saturday evening, and it was an incredible experience. First of all, the cocktails were amazing, the staff were really friendly, and the food? Oh. My. God. I would have taken a picture of the homemade guacamole and chips, but I destroyed those (it was bad, my mom would be ashamed if I still cared about her opinion). It wasn't just made with high quality ingredients, it was made with care and, dare I say, love.

For my main, I had the spicy red snapper tacos, and my partner ordered the steak. Both dishes were incredible, though the steak was a smidge underdone. My partner ended up sending it back, but they were really accommodating and brought it back perfectly cooked. The red snapper tacos were incredible, bursting with flavor and a mild heat that added to the whole experience.

Overall, we will definitely be going back, and if you've made it this far, why haven't you gone to Harvest Kitchen yet? Go!",5

Our waitress didn't even ask or look at our glass half filled with Pellegrino Sparkling water and just filled it up with tap water and walked away (while talking to another waiter!) I was shocked at how careless it was. She came to ask how the cake we ordered was for dessert without even looking (again), and we told her that we hadn't received the dessert yet! It's so hard to tip 20% for service like this, but it's not all about her and I hope it was just a bad day.",4

255,Legend 72,"127 W 72nd St, New York, NY 10023, USA",4.0,Stewart Miller,"I've read through the previous complaints regarding service, which I found baffling. I found the service to be very good and accommodating.

My dan dan noodles were excellent, and my crispy fish in sweet and sour sauce was cooked to perfection. Despite the obligatory warning from my waiter (this wasn't processed fish but rather a real fish after all), I found that my fish had almost no bones. In short, the preparation was excellent: so good, that I took a picture of my food, something I am usually loathe to do.

Here, sadly, was the problem with my experience. The freshwater fish selected for my meal (it may have been a trout or possibly a carp) had a distinctively earthy flavor. I chose to ignore the muddy aftertaste as the fish had been prepared very well. Later on in the evening, as I sat through a concert, I kept burping up that unpleasant earthy taste. This made for an unpleasant experience. This restaurant must improve its supply of freshwater fish. It should not permit a forty dollar entree to be ruined by inferior supply.

This may be one of the few instances where using farm-raised fish may be preferable to wild caught fish, as the filtration systems in farm-raised specimens tend to cancel out the muddy taste prevalent in wild-caught specimens.",3

It's better than almost all of Chinese restaurants I've been to. I think it's better than Che Li. If you like Mala, try Chendu fish fillet and mapo Tofu. If you like basic, simple lunch special, try Chao Fun, kung pao chicken or sesame chicken.",5

I found out from my wife afterwards the server started giving her attitude and speaking Chinese to comment because she thought i wasn't tipping. While all this was happening i was busy tipping 20% for our meal. If the restaurant management actually reads any of these reviews, please tell you staff to just  serve the food  and hold the attitude.",2

I'm gluten-free and they had one of the tastiest gluten-free sesame bagels that I have ever had!!! Every dish we ordered was superb, and the service was equally as impressive! Gavin could not have been kinder and more thoughtful as a server!! In a busy place like NYC, it was so awesome to feel so thoughtfully cared for!! While it may have been busy in the restaurant, I would have never noticed since Gavin was always there when we needed, so thoughtfully made sure whatever I ordered was safe for my allergies, and went above and beyond to help with my many menu questions! Thanks for a WONDERFUL brunch date. We will surely be back, especially if we get to sit in Gavin's section!!!",5

The food is delicious, with emphasis on the steak & eggs dishes for brunch. The food is extremely fresh and served within a generally quick timeframe. The servers are so friendly and prompt with their service.

I highly highly highly recommend Nice Matin for all of your dining needs!!",5

267,Nice Matin,"201 W 79th St, New York, NY 10024, USA",4.3,James Graydon,"I had brunch here with a group, and I really want to give it five stars, but I can't. I had an eggs benedict, but the eggs were somewhere between soft and hard boiled (decidedly not poached). That brought my overall experience down, unfortunately. The coffee, on the other hand, was the best I've had in a restaurant. I had a cappuccino and an espresso and both were vastly superior to the majority of dedicated coffee shops in the city. Verdict: I will happily come back, but I might not order eggs when I do.",4
268,Nice Matin,"201 W 79th St, New York, NY 10024, USA",4.3,Cherylynn Grubbs,"Edit to add- manager quickly responded and refunded my meal. I can’t think of anything more they could’ve done, but that quick response and apology helped me decide to change the experience to 5 stars.
Original review: Got seated and waited for 20 minutes at my table. After the first 5-10 minutes had passed, I asked several staff when I’d be waited on, and nobody waited on me. I watched people come in *after* me get waited on, as I continued to be ignored. They did manage to take the extra chair and place setting away from my table, just to remind me I was dining alone (which was tough, since I’m recently widowed and dining alone is difficult enough as it is) - I asked each time who was my server and they looked around and left. I saw someone who looked like a manager walking around, and every so often she looked at me, so I know she knew I was there. How didn’t she notice the menu still sitting on the table? I left because I needed to get going on my day and don’t have all morning to sit and watch wait staff wait on everyone except me -  room service was an option. I went back to my room and ordered room service instead, which came relatively quickly, but with missing items (no brown sugar, no regular sugar for my coffee, just fake sweeteners, and a very small container of maple syrup after I had asked for extra (since my kid didn’t want the rum anglaise) - came with a tiny bit in a small creamer container. I called down for more maple syrup (French toast is dry without it), and they said they’d send some to my room. Never. came. The food is great, but the service was non-existent for me in the restaurant, and very poor when needed to fix missing room service items. $21 for French toast should come with better follow up when the restaurant makes a mistake and needs to send more syrup as requested. My $14 oatmeal was bland without any brown sugar. My $7 pot of coffee tasted off with just fake sugar available. Very disappointing experience. I gave three stars since the food is prepared well. This isn’t a kitchen problem, it’s a customer service failure. I can’t remember the last time I was somewhere with service this bad, so I felt compelled to give feedback.",5

My husband and I were on our way to get something else when our train got delayed… we decided to walk down on Broadway and he had to stop for cash. We instantly changed our minds when we saw this place on the corner. It was one of those meant to be things… we’re so happy we did. We were greeted warmly by everyone there. My son who’s 3 was welcomed. They adored him! We ordered Chinese broccoli, chicken wings, fried vegetable dumplings, fried rice, and sesame chicken. The oolong tea was delicious! 💯 recommend!

I won’t really be coming back but the food was definitely fresh .
Vegetables was not on the house as well.
I’ll give the shrimp dumplings a 5/5 because it was fresh ! My House  special lo mein was not wow, neither was my friend’s fried curry fish.
It was a 2.8/5 experience",3

When I went to report the problem the form was not working, it kept saying there was an error and to try again. Now, I try a day later and it works, but the window to report problems is over. FOR REAL? I'm convinced that the Delivery Insurance is a joke and they probably make it ""error"" until the window to report issues closes.",1

284,Chama Mama UWS,"373 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10024, USA",4.6,Bobby Wang,"An unforgettable experience! The atmosphere is great. The service is fantastic! A wonderful detail is that their plates are carefully designed and customized, and provided according to the dish you order. Please note that there are different options for lunch and dinner!

The portion sizes are very good! The pumpkin soup is almost the best I've ever had, which might only be one-third the portion size in some other restaurants, but here it's very generous. The meat patties and cheese boat are not greasy at all! The soup dumplings are different from the Chinese style. Even though they look thick and big, they are still juicy and tasty when eaten!

In terms of the menu, the plates, the service, the atmosphere, or the food, it was impeccable. For me, whether for casual dining or formal occasions, this Georgian restaurant offers a unique and outstanding experience.",5

I would give five stars, except I felt like my waiter had been quite sassy with me. I asked for more information about the cheese type, and I was told it was cow Cheese cheese.... which was not very helpful. My waiter looked at me like I was crazy when I asked for more info about the cheese, which was off-putting. The other service staff was helpful and guided me through the menu much better.
The mocktail was bad. Gosh that cheese was good!",4
