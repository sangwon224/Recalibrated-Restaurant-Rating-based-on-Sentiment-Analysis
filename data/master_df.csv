We had the pretzel 'filled with jalapeno cheese' but there was No hint of jalapeno.
So it's just cheese filled, good but smaller than we expected. Not like your traditional large hot pretzel.
We had the turkey Ruben, which was good.

After spending time researching where to get a hot dog in New York it came down to Grays Papaya and Bilies Hotdog Cart. I chose here as this was a little closer, and I’m sure glad I chose it.

The hot dogs were delicious with loads of flavour and the papaya drink a was nice and  cold and lovely sweet flavour.

I got the Addicted which is 3 hot dogs and a large drink for about $10 which I thought was good value. I enjoyed it so much I got another one straight after.

Taste: the hotdog was grilled perfectly and the beans and cheese was the perfect combination for the flavour hit. The papaya flavoured drink is sweet and maybe not for everyone.

Service: The service was quick and friendly.

Staff: Very friendly and helpful.

Price: Well priced

Value: Great

Cleanliness: It was very clean behind the counter and inside looked clean too.

Location: We stayed downtown so it took us quite a while to get up to the store which is solidly uptown. There’s probably an easier way to get there (train/bus) but I thought the location is good as it’s not near Times Square or any ridiculously busy spot.

The wait: I waited less than 5 minutes for my first serving and less than 2 minutes when I ordered again.  This was around 2pm. I am sure it’s a lot busier at lunchtime.

The service here was great, and the flavor of the food was quite good; but not enough to justify the cost. We ordered the fish curry ($36), butter chicken ($30), bone marrow ($39), and garlic naan ($8). Neither the fish curry nor the butter chicken came with rice, which was a shock, given the cost of these dishes. While most of the food was well prepared, the fish in the curry was actually quite overcooked, and the fish itself would not have been enough for a full meal, which made the fact that this dish did NOT come with rice all the more baffling.
The butter chicken would have been worth the $30 if it also came with rice. Would consider dining here again if the prices were either 20% lower, or also covered the tip at the current prices.

There's no seating inside the shop, but the Eleanor Roosevelt Memorial Park is just a few blocks away if you're alright with enjoying your food outside! The food was tasty, but a bit heavy and oversaturated with oil for my taste -- I opted for the egg white omelette, which didn't include any cheese (yay for me and my lactose intolerant friends), but did have a boat load of fresh veggies! It was incredibly tasty, and honestly way bigger than I was expecting, but did make me feel pretty greasy afterwards. The potatoes were even more saturated in oil and a bit oversalted, but still delicious. The meal also came with toast, which was just white bread toasted in what smelled like butter, so I didn't end up partaking, but the friend that I had gone to brunch with said that it was oddly chewy (potentially because it had to be wrapped in tin foil immediately after toasting).

She opted for one of their signature avocado toasts, which she adored -- it looks small, but it was incredibly filling, especially since they load on what seems like half or all of an avocado onto a single, frail piece of multigrain toast. The bread definitely couldn't hold up the heft of the avocado and salmon for long, so she ended up just eating her toast with a knife and fork, but it was still delicious nonetheless.

The cashier was really sweet and helpful, but it did take an incredibly long time for us to get our food; even though we were the only ones in the restaurant, we ended up waiting upwards of 25 minutes to get our to-go orders.

My dan dan noodles were excellent, and my crispy fish in sweet and sour sauce was cooked to perfection. Despite the obligatory warning from my waiter (this wasn't processed fish but rather a real fish after all), I found that my fish had almost no bones. In short, the preparation was excellent: so good, that I took a picture of my food, something I am usually loathe to do.

Here, sadly, was the problem with my experience. The freshwater fish selected for my meal (it may have been a trout or possibly a carp) had a distinctively earthy flavor. I chose to ignore the muddy aftertaste as the fish had been prepared very well. Later on in the evening, as I sat through a concert, I kept burping up that unpleasant earthy taste. This made for an unpleasant experience. This restaurant must improve its supply of freshwater fish. It should not permit a forty dollar entree to be ruined by inferior supply.

This may be one of the few instances where using farm-raised fish may be preferable to wild caught fish, as the filtration systems in farm-raised specimens tend to cancel out the muddy taste prevalent in wild-caught specimens.",3.0,0.149,0.736,0.115,-0.8902,0.05409975,0.23021609,0.7156842,0.7496426

Original review: Got seated and waited for 20 minutes at my table. After the first 5-10 minutes had passed, I asked several staff when I’d be waited on, and nobody waited on me. I watched people come in *after* me get waited on, as I continued to be ignored. They did manage to take the extra chair and place setting away from my table, just to remind me I was dining alone (which was tough, since I’m recently widowed and dining alone is difficult enough as it is) - I asked each time who was my server and they looked around and left. I saw someone who looked like a manager walking around, and every so often she looked at me, so I know she knew I was there. How didn’t she notice the menu still sitting on the table? I left because I needed to get going on my day and don’t have all morning to sit and watch wait staff wait on everyone except me -  room service was an option. I went back to my room and ordered room service instead, which came relatively quickly, but with missing items (no brown sugar, no regular sugar for my coffee, just fake sweeteners, and a very small container of maple syrup after I had asked for extra (since my kid didn’t want the rum anglaise) - came with a tiny bit in a small creamer container. I called down for more maple syrup (French toast is dry without it), and they said they’d send some to my room. Never. came. The food is great, but the service was non-existent for me in the restaurant, and very poor when needed to fix missing room service items. $21 for French toast should come with better follow up when the restaurant makes a mistake and needs to send more syrup as requested. My $14 oatmeal was bland without any brown sugar. My $7 pot of coffee tasted off with just fake sugar available. Very disappointing experience. I gave three stars since the food is prepared well.

One person was  working the front section and a little overwhelmed. Nice enough guy, but it's too busy to keep up any service.

Try the Loomi, it's excellent!

Nothing stellar about the food or the presentation. The fresh pita was a nice addition, and the rice was good as well. The lamb was fresh enough, but a little overcooked and not seasoned as much as I'm used to when I'm in the Middle East. The flat wide skewer normally used for an Adana kebab was absent, so I got a round hotdog lamb stick. Fair enough, just different. The mixed salad had hardly any dressing, if any. At least it was fresh and diced small.

The mixed appetizer was a small portion and not worth the price to me. The onion chickpea side was a new one and not that appealing. I'm guessing that it is sumac on the pickled beats?

I'm being a little rough on this restaurant, but I expected better in NYC. Comparing it to every other Middle Eastern restaurant in the US only, I probably should give it 2.5 stars.

To add to the confusion, while we had to fetch our own food from the bar, neighboring tables received table service. When we requested a glass change due to lipstick, Rebecca's indifferent attitude was disheartening. As an Australian myself, I expected more from an Australian cafe.

Every facet, from the meticulously planned silverware to the elegantly crafted glasses, resonates with a meticulous investment of time and effort. The atmosphere exudes a palpable aura of class, making it an impeccable choice for those seeking to dazzle a date.

The Food: I went with the Nashville Hot Chicken Biscuit Sandwich Combo with a side of Mac N Cheese. I can tell you, from the plates I see being served to others, you will be in a food coma right after the meal! The fried chicken itself was cooked to perfection. Nice layer of crunchy skin, and tender meat that just break apart so easily. The meat was also very juicy and flavorful.  They had the Nashville hot seasoning down to a T. The Mac N Cheese was also a star player here. The pasta cooked well and the cheese combined together made it perfect. Right amount of gooey cheese that made every bite worth it.

The Service: Service was great! Ordered at the kiosk and waited for my order. Wasn't long before I was called to pick up mine for to go. Staff are nice and friendly as well.

The Atmosphere: Since it was a food stall, can't speak too much on it's own atmosphere. But they do have a bar area in front of their kitchen for you to eat. Not that much seating, so you may need to find another spot up or downstairs.

Let me break down our most recent meal. We started off with the warm mozzarella which is hands down the best in the city. The portion is a bit small but the taste makes up for it. We also started with the Arugula Salad which is always very good. For main courses we ordered the salmon, branzino, the veal and the pesto which we got to share. Both fish dishes were a relatively big portion and were very tasty. The veal was small but tasted really great and so did the potatoes that came along with it. Finally, the pesto was a pretty small portion, but very good. For dessert, the cappuccino was just the right size however it could have been a little warmer. We also got the tiramisu which was so so good. Finally the biscottis were just the right thing to top off the fabulous meal. Overall a great experience. 5 stars.",5.0,0.0,0.759,0.241,0.9938,0.0022301201,0.022803055,0.9749669,0.9830232

Service: The service at this establishment was prompt for the most part. Our coffees and water were refilled without having to ask, which was appreciated.

Food: The food had its ups and downs. The French toast, served with maple syrup on the side, was satisfying and met expectations. However, the avocado toast with poached eggs fell short. It lacked seasoning, leaving it bland and unremarkable. Additionally, the side salad accompanying the dish was uninspired, lacking flavor and freshness.

But, starting with the positives. The space features rustic wooden tables and lovely decor. We loved the ravioli doppio. The dish burst with fun and unexpected flavors. The veal Milanese hit expectations but did not exceed. And, we all enjoyed the Caesar salad, but then again, it’s hard to mess up a Caesar salad.

One in our party order and Arctic char. Bad move. The fish came cooked closer to sushi levels than the medium rare she ordered. And, she was disappointed with the taste.

Location: It is located at UES, lexington Ave. We made reservations cause it is always packed here! There is outdoor and indoor seating! The indoor is nice, quite dark. The outdoor is nice, feels like you are in Italy. Street parking available at the side

Service: OMG our server is nice. I noticed that she is in the elderly side, and I love that, it means that the restaurant does not discriminate! Thank you for that.

Expensive but it was just fried with a side of salad, nothing special for me. STRAWBERRY RHUBARB TORTA: omg this was good! The crust was so good and the filling was not that sweet which I like!

Both the restaurant itself and the food presentation were very aesthetic, with a lot of thought put into both. The service is quick and friendly, and the prices are good too— especially compared to other Thai spots in the area.

Food I tried:
- Garlic sauce sauté with mock duck (5/5): This was my favorite dish from here. The mock duck was super tasty, with a delicious meat-like texture and strong garlicky soy sauce flavor. You can really taste the garlic in the sauce, and it was really good.

- Bamee yok nah petd (3.8/5): I didn’t love this one as the noodles made up the majority of the dish yet they were kind of bland and overpowering. The duck was crispy and flavorful though. Because there wasn’t much else in this dish besides the noodles and duck, it was kind of a monotonous dish overall.

- Pad woon sen with mock duck (4.3/5): This was pretty good— again the mock duck was amazing and the glass noodles were flavorful and well-sautéed.

My favorite was a short rib grilled cheese.. a hefty, flavorful sandwich. The jerk chicken rasta pasta caught me by surprise for a place that isn't a Caribbean bar/ restaurant to have a pretty tasty rasta pasta. Right amount of spice, juicy chicken and nice texture and flavors of the sauce. The wings are good but it's actually on the spicier side. I really enjoyed the Mexican Sangria which has mezcal and red wine; it was strong. They even have daily specials with deals on drinks and food",5.0,0.031,0.834,0.136,0.9547,0.0034554973,0.048121106,0.94842345,0.9673008

Robert is on top of the Museum of Arts and Design, with impressive views of Columbus Circle and Central Park. We’d made reservations in advance but unfortunately were unable to sit by the windows with views. We still had a very enjoyable meal in this spacious and stylish restaurant.

We ordered the Rigatoni ($25+), Lobster Roll ($21+) and Scrambled Eggs & Caviar ($28+). The complimentary basket of bread and muffins was a nice addition.

The food was good, but the highlight for me was the festive atmosphere and Easter treats. They had a cotton candy stand, where they offered free cotton candy. And during our meal, an Easter bunny came around, waving and posing for photos.

This store constantly messes up orders (I ordered a supreme pizza as seen in the receipt for the pizza compared to the meatball that I got) is consistently an hour or more delayed in delivery of the food, and has their phone line disconnected as soon as your press 3 to try and connect to the restaurant directly. This is honestly the most disappointing Pizza Hut I’ve ever been to or ordered from. What a shame that this is the only Pizza Hut in Manhattan, clearly corporate oversight is nonexistent as can be evidenced by the pictures from the other reviews as well as my own experiences from the two times I ordered from this store. The first was during the recent Super Bowl, so I wanted to give the store the benefit of the doubt…but when I ordered again on a normal weekday (3/15/23) night, the same delay, issues, and lack of resolution from anyone at the store or through corporate.

I was craving the Pizza Hut taste from childhood, but I should have realized this particular store is the epitome of failure and nothing is going to be fixed anytime soon. Do yourself a favor and do not order for delivery at this store. You’re going to be in an endless loop with the automated phone line and corporate all to get incorrect, room temperature food about an hour after the slated delivery time.

Edited (3/16/23): I did get a hold of their corporate line and while they were effusively apologizing when offering a refund, nothing the phone operator said gave me any assurance that corporate would be following up with this store. I just wouldn’t risk ordering delivery from this place.

We were immediately transformed to what the family agreed was the roaring 20s with the modern NYC twist perfect for celebrating our son’s 20th birthday. Our birthday party consisted of about 14 people. The table was already set up when we arrived 15 minutes early we were greeted with open arms as if we knew each other. They greeted and treated us like family!!! The staff was beyond attentive. They understood the menu and our purpose for being there.  We brought in our own cake to celebrate our son‘s birthday And a huge chunk of the restaurant staff brought the cake out with sparkling lights and beautiful voices to sing happy birthday to our son I am looking forward to going back, and of course the tray of chocolate chip cookie deliciousness was a sweet, unexpected treat. if there is one thing that I would add, would be a mini kids menu as one of our guest was a two-year-old and the pallet of a child is simple/ plain ❤️🙏🏼🎂🍪🍪",5.0,0.0,0.772,0.228,0.9949,0.002275909,0.017098483,0.9806256,0.985761

Really really great pasta. The best I’ve had so far during my trip to NY. I got penne alla vodka (creamy) which was full of flavour, al dente pasta, and a good sized ported. My brother got the spaghetti pomodoro which he really enjoyed. My dad got the pollo parmigiana which was massive! Really huge pieces of chicken that also tasted delicious.

I would advise you make a reservation as it is very busy. Service was really good. Only thing was no one came to the table with Parmesan for our pasta so we did have to get a waiters attention before we could start eating. In the uk Parmesan is always brought out to the table but I’m unsure if that’s a thing here in NYC.

I would say soda was more expensive for a really tiny bottle compared to other places we’ve eaten.

The menu is not your typical sushi place, as they offer some other cooked options that are equally delicious. I loved the crispy rice with ahi tuna, the popcorn shrimp, and the cauliflower tempura.

The server inquired if we were vegan, and upon learning we were vegetarian, mentioned something about a 'happy sauce' or possibly oyster sauce. We were confused and sought clarification about the sauce, but the server vaguely indicated that it was in all dishes except two, pointing them out in the menu without further explanation, and then left.

We requested room temperature water, which the server initially brought but then took away and didn't return for another 5-10 minutes. When it came to ordering, we weren't very hungry and chose one appetizer and one main course. However, we were informed of a $15 minimum spend per person, compelling us to order another appetizer.

The Veg Dumplings were delicious, served without any sauce. The Veg Spring Rolls were tasty but too oily, accompanied by a sauce. The Veg Fried Rice, however, was bland, tasting of raw vegetables without any seasoning. We ended up using the sauce from the spring rolls to add some flavor to it.

The service felt rushed. As soon as we finished with a dish, the server immediately cleared the plates. This haste was also evident when my wife finished her meal; the server quickly removed her plate, giving the impression that they wanted us to leave promptly.

Regarding the bill, we paid the amount and included a tip, despite our dissatisfaction with the service and the minimum spend requirement. The server then returned to inquire about gratuity based on the suggested amount on the invoice. After we confirmed our tip, she followed us out of the restaurant, asking if there was something wrong with the service. It was uncomfortable and awkward, particularly when she insisted we write on the invoice that the service was satisfactory.

FOOD
I thought some of the dishes were quite good. We got an assortment of dishes for the table, including the pancakes which were quite delicious. I got the avocado toast for myself. The toast itself was okay and the avocado had mint running through it which I found to be a bit strange. However, the crispy potatoes were quite delicious and made the entire dish worth it in my eyes. The prices also weren't out there crazy, which I appreciated.

AMBIANCE
The inside of the restaurant was quite spacious. In fact, when you go downstairs it's amazing how much space there really is at this restaurant. There is a large dining area in the back that's more dimly lit, less natural light and has a more moody vibe (that's where we sat). The front of the restaurant is more well lit and reminds me of a diner. Overall, it was a great space and on Wednesday morning there really isn't a lot of people there so we felt we had the entire restaurant to ourselves!

The tartare trio was very delicious (the creamy wasabi is amazing - almost licked it off the dish) and comes with crispy waferish thing for a good crunchy texture. The nori taco was good and the fried nori held its crunch pretty well. The crispy shrimp was ok - just your normal variety of well fried shrimp in a light sauce. The Brussels sprouts were terrific (when aren’t they?) and plentiful. The octopus was just ok.

I don't really have anything too negative to say about this place; my only gripe would be I wish the lobster roll was a little bit bigger.

We arrived on time for our reservation. Host was very pleasant and we were seated promptly in this fairly small restaurant. Among several great menu offerings, were a selection from their cold bar that we don't get in the southern states- we opted for a combination of fresh selection of oysters and clams, and their mixture of fried calamaries, shrimp & fish to get started. For main courses I went with their lobster roll Connecticut style, and the rest of my party ordered steamed mussels, grilled octopus, and grilled shrimp. Our oysters/clams arrived and after a while it was obvious that our fried calamaries/shrimp had been forgotten. We mentioned it to the waitress and she said they were on their way out. We did get them 5mns later- they were very tasty and worth the wait. Fresh shucked oysters and clams were extremely fresh and just incredible. My lobster roll was made out of lobster claws and knuckles - I've had better $35 lobster rolls. Meat was kind of rubbery. Fries that came with it were nicely seasoned. Steamed mussels were very fresh but slightly overcooked and also rubbery - broth that came with it was nicely seasoned. Apparently both the octopus and shrimp were a hit as I didn't get to taste them. Overall a really great restaurant with lots of very fresh seafood.

I waited for my meal which didn’t take too long only to notice that my fries didn’t come with cheese.

So I asked them if they could give me a cup on the side. They go to the back to give me a cup of cheese. I honestly just assumed that they were going to give it to me, but brought it to the register and made one of the employees ring me up for a dollar cup of cheese, which should’ve already been on my meal because that’s what I asked for. I’m not gonna lie. I was pretty annoyed that they went out of their way to ring me up for a dollar cup of cheese that he could’ve just given me for the inconvenience.

I'm pleasantly relieved to report that the zeitgeist of the original has been maintained. We had the delicious escargot served in little deep pockets of garlic butter with crispy baguette slices, as well as the crispy artichoke, a perfectly executed Jewish Roman dish - Carcioffi alla Giudia. While the menu description said garlic aioli, it was actually just a (deliciously) flavored smooth mayonnaise and lacked the bite I've come to expect from a true aioli. We also ordered the croque madame, which was perfection on the plate, with a side of deliciously crisp and evenly dressed gem lettuce, as well as the Quiche Florentine which looks like it was baked in a deep dish pizza pan or spring form. Truly a magnificent height and was equally flavorful. Of course, brunch would not have been complete without their impeccably balanced Bloody Mary (I take mine with Hendricks).

Tourist areas that were extremely crowded and I’d had enough of the crowds.  I asked some locals “Where do the locals go?”  Catch Steak was suggested to me so I made reservations, then decided to read the reviews.  After reading some of the reviews I almost cancelled my reservations bc a few said staff was rude and food wait was long.  I decided to go and form my own opinion.  My experience was quite different from the negative reviews.  When I walked in I was greeted with a warm welcoming. I arrived early for my reservations bc I wasn’t sure of traffic times.  I was asked if I’d like to check my coat in while I dined, which I thought was great!  since I was early I was offered a seat at the bar for a cocktail till my table was ready.  Although I was early and sat at the bar to have a cocktail, I didn’t have the time to finish it before my table was ready.  I was seated 15 min early.  The wait staff was really friendly, attentive and offered great suggestions.  My food came out in a timely manner,  was excellent and worth the price I paid and the experience I had.  The managers even came around checking on me  as well as other patrons in the restaurant.  I observed the staff working together helping each other out.  I was impressed to see management pouring water if the noticed a glass was getting low and making sure each table was taken care of.  One review said no photos could be taken, so I asked about that.   I dined alone and wanted a picture in there and the staff was happy to take my picture.  When I questioned about that the manager told me they  don’t allow flash photography.  Needless to say I was happy to have gone and form  my own opinion of Catch Steak!

I was a bit skeptical (why are there available reservations the day before a Saturday evening Broadway show AND on St Patrick's Day weekend??), but I am SO GLAD we ate here.

We got there at 5:25 for a 5:30 reservation. They weren't quite ready for us, so we had a drink at the bar and chatted with an extremely friendly and efficient bartender who was from the Ukraine (I'm sorry I didn't get your name!). We were seated within about 15 minutes and received excellent, efficient service. The delicious, crusty, complementary bread came not with tomato sauce like I'd expect, but lentils. I LOVE lentils and I had to restrain myself from eating it all.

My family got a variety of pasta dishes off the menu and not a speck was left of them. I got a fish/spinach/green bean special and I was sad I couldn't bring it with me because I couldn't finish it all. It was fantastic! The service was attentive without being overbearing.

It was definitely a typical crowded NYC restaurant (but again, we were there on a Saturday night so it's probably different at other times) and tables were close together. I personally like this ambiance, but if you don't, now you know.

I give this meal an unreserved 5 stars and I wish I lived in NYC so I could go back and try more of their food. We didn't get dessert, but we saw multiple desserts served to other tables and were quite jealous!",5.0,0.046,0.765,0.188,0.9946,0.029775165,0.27455178,0.69567305,0.7882862

It's a well-oiled machine and the staff are super friendly. Look forward to returning next visit! 🍕

1. The beehoon’s gravy was way too watery and oddly sweet. I’d attribute the success of the original store to their thick, flavorful and savory gravy that no other store in Singapore could compete with, but unfortunately, this was not it
2. The chilli was also very different from that in their original store. It lacks the sharp and tangy taste to it, and tasted much more like store bought hot sauce
3. The ingredients used in the beehoon were lacking too. Pork was too lean and tough. It is also missing the squid, which I think is an essential part of this dish too

Be sure to bring your ID after 7pm plus whole day Sunday and make reservations before you go. Thalia is the one of the friendliest staffs I’ve encountered. She recommended us some authentic Nigerian dishes. It’s seasoning and taste that you’ve never had before. Grab a few cocktails, some starters, with entrees and watch the game! For those who like to explore, try their peppered snail imported from West Africa. Other authentic dishes include Peri-Peri Chicken and their Lagos Fried Rice with your choice of protein. Save room for their delicious desserts. Red velvet is perfectly moist and the warm brownie is wonderfully chewy.

Food: Food is excellent. It comes out really fast but you can tell that it's fresh. The noddles are oily as expected but the dim sum is amazing! We got a lot of the steamed items and it was so good.

Basically paid $27 for rice and fat.

Tip - if you get fries, ask them to be cooked longer than they usually cook them to get a crisper fry while keeping their soft inside. Also if you order the BLT, expect an obscene amount of bacon (good!). Generally, I’d say the service here is also good.

The restaurant was very quiet, only 5 other tables seated in the restaurant. Our server Marco G was very nice and pretty attentive.

I generally won't visit a chain steakhouse in the city because there are just so many other options, but I needed something close and convenient.

We ordered thick cut bacon, french onion soup, crab cocktail, lobster cocktail, meatballs, and chef bacon cheeseburger. The french onion soup had no taste/flavor. I didn't even know it had onions in it other than seeing them in the crock. The bacon was great but comes with a basalmic glaze that isn't noted on the menu. Crab cocktail was ok, nothing to really write home about. However, it was better than than the lobster cocktail. The lobster was tasteless and almost seemed that it had been sitting in water, it was overcooked. The server didn't bring a shell bowl until asked to do so. The meatballs were tasteless as well. We only ate 1.5 out of the skillet. Lastly, the burger, I paid more for the chef burger because I wanted the aged Vermont cheddar, but the cheese seemed to be one step up from a kraft single. I asked for the bacon to be well done. There was a half a slice of bacon on the burger, leaving half of the burger with no bacon. To take the cake, the burger was well done when I ordered it medium. It was dry, and I mustarded through to just a little less than half of it. When Marco asked if I wanted it boxed I explained to him that it was well done. He went over to his manager. However, when the check came, the burger was still listed.

This wouldn't have been a big deal if I wasn't paying for soup that I only ate 4 /5 sips of meatballs that we only ate 1.5 of and then the burger. I am extremely disappointed if the kitchen is tired and feeling overworked than get new kitchen staff or close the restaurant.

While we were exhausted walking around craving a vegetarian meal, we stumbled upon this place, and here is the summary of our review:

My actual rating is 3.5 but because they made us wait so long, it was an unpleasant experience.

1) Ambiance 4/5: The place is small but given the location, they have done well to maintain the ambiance of this place

2) Service 2/5: This is by far my biggest sore here. We had to wait for over 30 minutes for a burger and burrito on the pretext of it being about to be closed and they didn't even give us the extra sauce which we asked and they even mentioned in their bill. This was disappointing as they could have stopped entertaining guests if it was too late.

3) Food 5/5:  Here is the summary of the food we had. The food was really tasty and filling.

a) Beyond burrito: Great if you are looking for a filling single meal. It has great taste.

b) PS burger: Again a juicy and great vegan burger with beyond patty and cheese

4) Value for Money 4/5: Not the cheapest place as simple burritos and burgers and about $18 but given its location, it would not be cheap.

Overall, great tasting vegan food but not the best service experience and if you are looking for something cheap, try one of the local shops around.

Secondly the level of service is very poor and the personnel is clearly non trained for a supposed high-level restaurant. During the waiting time for the preparation of the table, the personnel offers you a cocktail (nobody told us what it was, and I have assumed that it was a Spritz, but not sure! Nothing have been offered to our 3 kids) and some appetizers. They put everything on the desk at the entrance and don’t go through the various clients.
Food quality is medium-high, but clearly no wow. Wine pairing is a nightmare. The wine chosen for every dish is simply horrible..Unacceptable for Europeans! Please allow clients to chose a bottle of wine or to pay more to have better quality.
At last, we wait 10 minutes (!!!) in a queue to have the elevator and go out…we were waiting for a lady from the restaurant with a badge which allows to call the elevator. Crazy!

The Apple Caramel Crumb Tart and toast were beyond words, simply legit and delicious. It's one of those places that keeps pulling you back in, making you fall in love with it a little more each visit. But the real surprise was the Egg Cream, served up in a delightful vanilla flavor. Contrary to what I initially thought it might taste like (somewhere close to eggnog?), it was wonderfully creamy with a light, velvety, and slightly fizzy texture. The vanilla was hearty and present, making the drink resemble a toned-down milkshake. Absolutely loved it and it's apparently a must-try NY diner classic. The service was attentive, adding to the overall great experience.

The onion rings were amongst the best I’ve ever had - light batter with the right amount of seasoning and the oil was fresh.

The bangers and mash were good too. Just the right amount of everything on the plate.

From the moment you step inside, you're greeted by the tantalizing aroma of freshly baked pizza dough mingling with rich tomato sauce and gooey cheese. The atmosphere is lively and welcoming, with a steady stream of customers eager to get their hands on a slice of this affordable culinary delight.

But let's talk about the star of the show: the pizza itself. Each slice is a masterpiece of simplicity and taste. The crust is thin and crispy, providing the perfect canvas for the rich tomato sauce and generous sprinkling of cheese. Whether you opt for a classic cheese slice or venture into more adventurous territory with toppings like pepperoni, sausage, or mushrooms, you can rest assured that each bite will be bursting with flavor.

What truly sets 1.50 Slice NYC Pizza apart, however, is its unbeatable value. In a city where prices seem to climb higher every day, this pizzeria offers a welcome reprieve for budget-conscious diners.

In February of 2024, I brought and treated myself and my wife for dinner at Capital Grill, specifically the branch based at the Chrysler Center, to celebrate our Happy Six Year Anniversary!!!

We’d like to thank Capital Grill for making our anniversary truly special, and one in which we’ll forever cherish.

We were warmly welcomed by the restaurant’s staff and were quickly provided with a very comfortable table. Throughout the evening, the staff graciously acknowledged and wished us a wonderful anniversary and thanked us for celebrating the occasion at Capital Grille.

Our server, Corey O treated us with impeccable hospitality and made us feel very welcomed and right at home!!! He was kind, incredibly courteous, superbly addressed all of our inquiries and offered great insight and suggestions on the menu options.

In addition to the great service, both my wife and I were impressed with Capital Grille’s elegant settings, especially the dark wood paneled interior, the tall glass windows, and the gorgeous art portraits spread throughout the restaurant. The playing of jazz music and classic hits sung by Billie Holiday & Louis Armstrong were also a great treat and enriched our romantic evening!!!

Last, but certainly not least, my wife and I absolutely loved our meals. Everything from the appetizers to the entrees to our dessert was perfectly delicious!!! On a scale of 1 to 10, I would grade our meals a score of “ Infinity & Beyond.”

My wife ordered and enjoyed her lamb chop based entree & her spinach side dish, while I ordered and loved my pan seared salmon based entree & my mash potato side dish. Our meals were superbly seasoned, tasty and wonderfully cooked. Our dessert, the Classic Crème Brûlée was simply off the charts and unquestionably delicious!!!

No signs, no way of knowing it’s there if you haven’t been tipped off, the most elaborate sake menu I’ve seen since being in Tokyo and food that taste just like it did in Japan.

The ambiance of the place is lovely too— as is the transition from the heavily lit lobby of the apartment building down a flight of stairs that is half way between NYC and Tokyo to a full immersion into Tokyo, complete with cherry blossoms.

Everything on the menu looked great and given the location, right next to the UN, the prizes are reasonable. We had the udon noodles, edamame beans, and a rice soup bowl. To top it all off we shared the sesame cheesecake with matcha, which was as good as it sounds.

The restaurant was also really cool. Very nice décor, cool tables where you take your shoes off and get an intimate corner for you and your group. It all felt like quite the experience.

The original chain is from Ebisu in Tokyo and is still there so you know it's authentic. While you can do the course menus, I find the a la carte is tasty, high quality and not that crazy. Get the signature steak selection, the negi rice and the yukaejang.

A chef friend recommended this place many many times but we only recently finally gave it a try. Wow - love it. It's a small spot but you instantly feel like you're back in Tokyo (or if you've never been, this is what a Tokyo resto feels like) sitting down for yakiniku.

We splurged on some of the apps the first time. Yukhoe (I can skip personally), wagyu sushi (do not skip). The kimchi platter is good to eat between bites but I prefer the Toraji salad. The negi rice, it's so simple but that egg yolk with all them scallion whites. BOMB.

OK, onto the meat. Skirt steak was lovely, nice and beefy, well marbled. The Toraji signature steak selection is great if you want to try the greatest hits. The thick beef tongue (do not miss this please), the filet, wagyu loin, a little bit of everything. It's simple but the cuts are very high quality. We did the yukaejang with the ramen noodles but I think I prefer the soup on its own.

However, their food is pretty typical of the food that Thai-Nam has, in that it's fairly awful.  I had the chicken teriyaki lunch special.  It came with three shumei dumplings, three pieces of a California roll, salad and rice.

None of it was good.

The chicken had been frozen, and the texture was awful.  The shumei were greasy, the sushi was also pre-made.  The standard Japanese salad dressing was similarly bad.  The only thing that made this even vaguely worthwhile was that you do get a lot of food for ten bucks.  But it's really bad food.

I tried their United Nations cocktail which was very strong in the lemon flavor over elderflower so I didn't like it either. The guacamole and chips lacked in seasoning and they only gave 8 or 10 chips. The fries were deliciously hot and thick and well seasoned. Highly recommend the fries!,4.0,0.058,0.726,0.216,0.9233,0.27871108,0.41388038,0.30740857,0.09628214

I have tried most of the dishes they serve, my favorites are the Ilasepo, the honey beans with corn and dodo
( heaven in a plate) the spicy snails, which has just the right amount of spice (nothing over the top) and the goat meat peppersoup which is the perfect hangover remedy or even the perfect acquaintance for a cold day. The meat is so tender.

The potions are good and they’re always well packaged, to avoid spills. I would be mad if that happened because I do not play with my Naija food. Every now and then they also send a freebie to thank me for my consistent patronage, which I truly appreciate.
When I feel homesick, (which is a lot of times these days), DF Nigerian food truck really helps me cure that. Definitely my go-to for authentic Nigerian meals.

They were already out of fried plantain so early in the day for a food service that is open until 7 pm or later.
I bought goat meat stew, Jollof rice, efo riro and agege bread. Only the goat meat stew was tolerable. Everything else was horrible. The efo riro was not fully cooked. The vegetables (spinach) was crunchy to the bite. It was plain without ‘emi’ in it, boring and tasteless.
Next Jollof rice omg! on a scale of 1-10, it was 0/10. Tasteless, flavorless overcooked rice. Horrible to say the least. The worst of it all was the agege bread. They offer full loaf or half loaf. I ordered full loaf but I was given half loaf without any explanation. I was not aware of the switch until I got home. As if that wasn’t bad enough, please be aware, they keep most of their food in the freezer including bread so they are not freshly made. The frozen bread was defrosted in the microwave. Can anyone believe it? Well this is not a joke because it happened to me. By the time I got home, the bread was as hard as stone.
I paid over $60 that day and gave a big tip and got food that was inedible except the goat meat which I ended up eating by itself. The rest went in the trash.

The bread we were served almost cracked a tooth it was so stale. On the menu, quite a limited selection of food, including only a few pasta options. I got the salmon, thought it was pretty steep to be $39 but figured it would be a decent sized piece and come with a few sides. My fiancé got the bolognese. Please just take a look at the photo to see what you'd get for $39 salmon. A very hard and unripe tomato next to a piece of grilled salmon. Not a side on the plate - typically served with mashed potatoes, spinach, etc. the bolognese was disgusting. I spoke with the manager who was dismissive and told the waiter to get me a side dish.

So we ordered their flan and dessert wines and were trying to enjoy the evening. That's when the waiter told us to hurry up because they needed the table for someone else.
It was exactly 1 hour from the time we sat at the table until we were asked to empty the table.

I finally got to visit the store in Midtown on one weekend for lunch. The staff (lovely Japanese female) told me that shortly before we arrived, a large group of people came and bought out most of their bento boxes!!! So, there was not much selections left… And, it seems like their donburi items are offered during weekdays, not on weekends. Double punch there…

We looked through their limited options, and picked up a few things that still looked really great. Since there is no seating in this location, we decided to take them home. The first item was their Pork Cutlet Curry, which comes with a small drink of your choice. We also bought a couple of rice balls and a Chocolate Mochi Doughnut.

They were all rather simple yet comforting and pretty good flavor. I was super happy I finally got to visit BentOn. I would definitely go back again when I want something quick, comforting, tasty, and Japanese.

Since i started traveling to this area, they have had that Grand Opening sign outside so I'm unsure of exactly when it opened.

The place itself is tiny. I appreciate that they have self service machines to place your orders. It helps those of us who rather explore the menu on our own and at our pace. The drinks are off to the side and can be picked up the customer. I love that idea however, I already witness a homeless person actually take a drink without paying. So thats the only down side to having the drinks available to anyone.

The empanadas here are good. Theres only one that i have fallen inlove with. The reggaeton is the name of it. It has rice and peas inside and pulled pork. It sounds crazy but it WORKS. They put a bunch of flavor into this empanada. Its not dry but very juicy. I highly recommend it. I did get the Toro one and it came with oxtail and sweet plantains. I dont recommend that one. The plantains were NOT sweet and i did not enjoy the flavor on the oxtail. The beef empanadas are good. I've had both fried and baked. Baked is delish.

I took a gambled and ordered the fried pork with tostones. It was horrible but wasnt the best. It could of been crisper but then the meat would of been burned. The tostones were perfect!!! Thin, crispy. I did not enjoy the sauces i ordered. The garlic is really good but i didnt like the pink or green sauce.

I tried the homemade lemonades here. They need to be more consistent. I bought two and one was soooo sour. I tried the next and it was sweet and not sour. So i wouldnt personally try it again because its almost $5 and still needs to be adjusted. I got the cherry lemonade and i couldnt taste the cherry in it at all. Just sour lemon.

Nothing in here is cheap. Not even the empanadas.

Overall, i will continue to come here and order empanadas. I def recommend ordering through the app because you wont have to stand in here and wait. The empanadas do NOT come out quickly as they are fried on demand...which is a plus.",4.0,0.052,0.818,0.131,0.9866,0.014785961,0.09814301,0.88707095,0.9139635

I was greeted immediately and was seated. The table was quite clean and the restaurant was pretty much empty. I was served pretty good bread, I did like that there was a slight charcoal aftertaste.

I ordered a ginger ale and grilled calamari. The calamari was plated well, and it built the anticipation for me to indulge. I was happy with the first bite. I haven’t had grilled calamari in a while, and this was a good portion and it was tasty/filling.

I was also given dessert which resembled a cheesecake, and it was pretty decent.

In all, I wouldn’t mind coming back and trying more of the menu, especially the seafood. The one thing I  would say is that I was charged $20.95 for Calamari and I was there after 4 pm (their Happy Hour is from 4 pm-6 pm).

When we first arrived to the restaurant the place was packed and full, you could really tell that they’re known for their fine quality levantine food. I had originally booked our table for 7:45, but unfortunately was not seated till about 8:30 which was pretty disappointing but it appeared that on that night they had open tables, hence the overbooking.

When we first stepped in we were greeted with the warmest hospitality by the waiters and were met with the fine geacw scent of freshly baked pita bread.

We glimpsed quickly through the menu, full of the finest Lebanese meals and finally decided on getting Hummus Bal lahma, balade mixed grill, beef shawarma, and rose water.

I will have to say though their hummus bal lahma was very soft as hummus should always be when made finely, so it really settled well on our tongues.  The mixed grill kebab was as fine as it got in terms of levantine kabab, their chicken shish tawoq especially had the most tender and mouthing watering texture that absolutely made your heart meltThe beef shawarma was served with rice and a nice Mediterranean salad; their rice was very soft and warming with the vermicelli cooked into it. Me personally, I’ve never been the biggest fan of beef shawarma but the experience I had at Balade completely altered my perspective, I definitely look forward to coming back and having their shawarma again.

Finally the rose water that really complimented the whole meal, something sweet and light that balances out the savory meats we had.

I do also want to emphasize on how soft and warm their pita was, hats off to the chef all the way.

Our waiter Jawad, if I’m not mistaken, was very welcoming and enthusiastic made us feel right at home and even helped us chose out their tastiest meals.

The service attitude is okay.
(I don't want to ruin a business by giving them one star because I know it's difficult to have a family owned business... but also, damn.)

The atmosphere is a bit off as well... there is a strong trash odor immediately before you enter the establishment, and then it becomes faint and lingering once you're inside. Another observation I made was that the soda machine was dripping as well, which required a cup to sit underneath the spout to catch it, but that's neither here nor there, because I'm sure soda machines, or rather machines in general-tend to malfunction every so often.

To my prior experience, the food takes about an average of 20+ minutes for a platter type dish. I waited about 10 minutes for my kebab this time, which was a reasonable wait time.

The food: honestly bad. I have never gone more than 5 bites. I thought maybe it's because I have a particular palette, but the food here tends to be too sour or too salty, or overseasoned in some way, and the quality of the meat is questionable as well. In particular, I ordered the chicken kebab with garlic and herb flavoring today and received this mushy, spongy chicken kebab that was too sour and the meat was just honestly very questionable. I have attached the pictures of it as well.

Please just do yourself a favor and pick a different spot.

Honestly, not the best or mind-blowing burgers you’ll ever have. But for pretty big portions, crunchy hot fries and onion rings, and pretty good burger, this place is awesome.

I tried their wings, mac n cheese, buffalo fried chicken burger, and their meat burger. I also tried their garlic fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings. Honestly all of them were really good but the man n cheese with the meat was not so much because the neat had a weird distinct flavor.

Also, you should definitely try the sweet chili sauce with the fries and rings! Again, their portions are really big and it’s a great place for a nice filling lunch!

This simple American eatery serves grass-fed meat & veggie burgers, plus salads & chicken wings. The burgers are packed with flavor, quality, and everything is fresh. I really enjoyed the halal double burger. The customer service was exceptional. This is by far one of the best burger spots I have ever been to.

The service and atmosphere were both solid. The space is a bit crammed though and there is a scent of truffle that fills the restaurant. It smelled good but perhaps they need a bit more ventilation.

This gimmick and the well-decorated space popularized the restaurant with its mysterious atmosphere.

While the head chef is very kind and the service is solid, Mr. Moto has a huge flaw. The course preparation isn't only done by the head chef. Multiple chefs create inconsistencies, this was even worse because the other chef clearly didn't take his job very seriously.

Not only was he less skilled (rice portions were different each time), he also didn't care about the details. He would leave a few grains of rice left on top of the fish or pour too much sauce by accident. The worst was when the nigiri literally fell apart. I watched him realize, place the fish on top, and serve it anyways.

Ambiance: Such a beautiful vibe. It's intimately lit which makes it a great spot for date night. It's also got a great bar with this gorgeous decor over it. The environment really makes you want to sit and grab a drink before dinner.

Food: The food is small plate style. I like this concept because it gives me a chance to try more of the menu. We got most of the veggie ""to share"" plates and 2 of the pasta dishes. Every single item did not disappoint. Each dish was well seasoned and balanced. Some of the combinations sounded different but they worked really well together.

Service: Service was pretty perfect. Everyone checked in the right amount and even gave us great recommendations on what we should order.

But what soured me about this place was not the food, or the super long wait times, or even the fact that the steak dish we ordered came was raw and uncooked and we had to send it back (which I feel terrible doing). What soured me was their ""surge pricing"" model.

Call it surge pricing, or price gouging.. the lunch menu lists the burger for $11, while the brunch menu lists it for $19. So I asked ""what's the difference between the burger on the lunch menu versus brunch"", and the server said ""none"". So of course I asked ""any additional sides or anything"" and they responded again ""no they're the same"".

But since they don't offer the lunch burger menu before 5pm, I agreed to get the higher priced brunch burger. But I asked if they could do the Swiss bacon burger instead (which is $13 on the lunch menu), but the server refused and said I'd have to pay the additional fees to upgrade from American cheese to Swiss, and to add bacon. So I was up-charged to $24, for the same burger that will cost $11 less, only 1.5 hours later.

- Miso Glazed Salmon
- oysters
- shrimp appetizer (I forgot the name but we liked it so much we got a Sedona order)
- the lobster bao bun was great
- angry muscles were also interesting, especially if you are a kimchi fan

Linden’s is a chic and very simple restaurant that is beautifully accentuated by the decoration and wide open spaces. The food service is exceptional and the waiters are very knowledgeable and courteous. After every plate, we were brought new silverware and our table was wiped off. The waiters were very tentative to refill our glasses and would bring us another bottle of water promptly.

The food service was quick, we didn’t have to wait very long for it to come out nice and hot. We were here twice and ordered the pancakes, the avocado toast, the carrot ravioli, the giardiniera with pita bread, the burgers and the strawberry tart. All was super delicious and the waiters checked on us periodically to make sure that we were satisfied.

It was our anniversary and Isaiah (the manager) made it very special for my wife and I- the both times we visited! A very well spoken gentleman, made sure to check up on us throughout our visits. Definitely elevated the experience tenfold. We are very grateful for the wonderful service we received from Isaiah, our waiters and Zeury at the front desk.

We were greeted with warmth and sat at a lovely corner table facing the entire restaurant. The environment was classy and comfortable featuring soft cozy seating (which is lacking in some upscale spots) which set the tone for relaxation and immediately made us excited to scan the menu. We started with bread and their house mushroom butter (which I wish I had a case of) followed by tuna tartare that was so flavorful and yet so light as well as the burrata which I highly recommend as a sort of palate cleanser as it is fresh and hums of spring. We indulged in a plate of gnocchi which honestly knocked my socks off and made me sink into my seat (or it could have been the well balanced cocktails we were sipping on - get The Underdog if you like rye). Now we get to the main players which proved to be classic, simple and very well done - the lamb as well as the wagyu. I appreciate that the proteins were featured with delicate reductions and seasonal greenery really honoring the ingredients. We wrapped up the night with a little dessert spread with the sorbet being our favorite and also such a fun presentation. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the extraordinary service from beginning to end with Sammy being our guide with excellent explanations of all dishes and Adam who set us up and proved to be an accommodating and gracious host.

Mezzanine is the breakfast restaurant in the Dominick, and I met her here damn near every morning of her trip, as I'm not one to pass up a free breakfast.

Honestly, this is some of the most insane price gouging I've ever seen in my life. We were CRACKING up when we saw the $9 americano, the $9 coke, the $18 grape fruit. Even for NYC this is insane ahahahaha.

I would get the $42 American Breakfast that comes with 2 eggs, potatoes, cherry tomatoes, turkey bacon, toast, orange juice, and a coffee. Honestly, this was EASILY the most bang for your buck on the menu.

I will be fair, the breakfast did SLAP. Some of the best turkey bacon I've had in a minute. Normally turkey bacon is just a sad excuse for bacon, but this one actually tasted like good bacon. It was bangin.

The orange juice was also AMAZING. One of my simple pleasures in this life is some actual freshly squeezed orange juice. There is nothing like it… If you just get the OJ though, it's $12 for MAYBE 16 oz. That just threw a sandbag on my excitement ahahha. Not worth it... and they even forget my OJ I had to ask about it twice smh don't play with me and my OJ!

Even if you have Nanc bread, these prices are just laughable. They should change the name of this place to PriceGougeanine.

Reception comes back and tells my Asian wife and I that there is a 10 min wait. I say ""that couple came in after us, and you just found them a seat"" and she says sorry there's a wait.

So much for staying here, being guests at the hotel and treating people fairly. Let's see how the food is, but so far 0 stars for service.

UPDATE: Finally seated about 15 minutes later, and that experience carried straight into breakfast. We were seated while two different tables were actively complaining about the service.  I felt better seeing the couple that was seated earlier looking annoyed and having no water or drinks on their table.

We had the impudence to ask for drinks and coffee, and then looked through the menu. A whole, 40+ minutes go by before we get our coffee. Something crazy going on here, over half the food going to tables was being sent back to the kitchen. Not over cooked steaks…things like waffles and pancakes. How is that even possible? Waiters seemed stressed out, but ample people available. One lady just setting and cleaning tables, waiting for people to leave, and setting and cleaning tables. Meanwhile, people don’t have water and food. Table next to us left without paying the bill. Another table complained and had their meal comped. Absolute dumpster fire, but highly entertaining in that “watching it implode” kind of way.

Shashuka was good. Medium rare steak was cold and well done, not even sure how that is possible. Chicken sausage has the thickest rubber’iest casing I’ve ever had, to the point where we were wondering if it was still covered in plastic.

After all this, they have 20% gratuity pre-billed! How is this part of a “five diamond” hotel? Absolutely ridiculous experience.

Food and drinks: We ordered a few drinks and they had virgin drinks/alcoholic drinks but plenty to choose from. They were pretty good.

For appetizers we ordered Polpo which was the grilled octopus with potatoes, capers, olives and red onions. This was delicious and the olives and capers added so much flavor to the dish.

The restaurant is beautiful. The staff was amazing. The food, quite honestly, was just not that good at all.

We ordered two appetizers: tuna tartare and meatballs. The presentation of both dishes was beautiful, but the taste did not match the look.

The tuna tartare was flat, and tasteless, overwhelmed by the over-sized portion of avocado. The meatballs tasted like an old dish rag. The marinara sauce was almost flavorless. Even the breadbasket with small scraps of bread and a tasteless spread was underwhelming.

We decided not to stay for the main course. I can't remember the last time we've done that.

The tuna was kind of… dull? It was still pretty fresh, but all the flavors kind of muddled together. Also, the tuna looked like it was smashed or something, which I guess made it soft to the bite, but I found it soft to the point of being almost mushy, which was unappetizing.

The arroz con pollo was rather unremarkable. Yes, the chicken was very tender. Yes, the skin was crispy. But the rice was also on the verge of mushy (sensing a theme here), and there didn’t really seem to be anything else with the dish to liven it up. I got a little tired of spooning the chicken rice mash into my mouth. Also, there was hot sauce, but it was very mild for a Mexican restaurant, which was a bit sad.

The churros were fine. They were quite tasty, even, and I really enjoyed the melted chocolate it came with. However, the churros also crumbled easily, rather than staying crisp, so by the end I could have used a spoon to fish out the bits that broke off into the chocolate sauce.

Reservations were made for three on Open Table, and when we arrived we were seated right away. As per previous reviews JLC is dimly lit, going for the trendy chic vibe.

The restaurant week offer was 3 courses for $45. We went with three different appetizers and shared.
Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura, Vegetable Spring Rolls and Crispy Chicken Wontons. The top two were the chicken wontons and rock shrimp. For an entrée I chose the slow cooked glazed salmon and so did a friend. I was not impressed and truthful neither was my friend. The salmon was slightly overcooked rendering it a tad dry and I was not pleased with the glaze. Another dining companion order the Pow Pow Beef and was in-love, too bad I don't eat beef.

For desserts we tried the Chocolate Lava Cake and Everyday's Your Birthday Cake, the ladder was also dry. The cocktails we tried were the Dusse Sidecar & Lychee Martini both were very tasty @ $20 a glass.

Overall give them a try if you haven't already, the apps were a hit. Keep in mind it is Asian cuisine on the higher end in retrospect to what one may expect.

The service was on point. Caring but not intrusive. Not condescending as some other fine dining restaurants may be. Staff was all knowledgeable and easy to chat with.

While a bit of a splurge, it's the right balance of a celebratory meal that feels luxurious yet still refined. For a beef-centric meal, you won't have crazy meat sweats but you'll still feel like you got your money's worth.

Tucked behind of Oiji Mi - I'm surprised it's taken me this long to write this review. For a tasting that's got beef top of mind, it's not overly beefy. In fact, the first several courses showcase the team's skill with seafood dishes.

The starter plate with a crispy seaweed tartare bite, two caviar-esque tartlets, a marinated sashimi component. You might actually think this was a kaiseki/omakase meal if it were not the Frenchy elements.

As you progress through the first parts of the meal, your proteins for the evening are showcased and are grilled table side as you make your way to the beef portion. A steamed-egg custard with crab, it almost tastes like a Cantonese dish. An abalone plate with wild rice, a ginger scallion fish with broth. You almost forget that this is a beef-themed tasting and then, that part arrives.

Two pieces one with sea urchin roe and the other with caviar. So tender, salty, briny, perfect. Next a rice bowl with ikura, gamtae seaweed, marinated beef. Mix it up and enjoy. After a beef course with fermented veggies, then the wagyu which is served more French-ish. The final savory part was a tray with rice, crispy seaweed, soup, all different types of sauces to make miniature hand rolls if you will.

The desserts were just as good as the savory part. Again, more of a special occasion kind of spot but it's a proper way to splurge.",5.0,0.006,0.859,0.135,0.99,0.014862393,0.18438871,0.80074894,0.8706497

However, not sure if the entire menu was worth.

My favorites of the current menu were: the bluefin tuna “taco”; the sablefish with daikon broth and meyer lemon; the nuruk-aged beef with caviar; the wagyu galbi; and the dry aged beef. I think the nuruk-aged beef was probably one of the best bites of beef I have ever had.

For me, experience felt two Michelin - until I had the hansang charim. I was a little confused; after all the amazing food and the buildup we had, the savory courses ended with a daikon beef soup, rice, and kimchi. It was like an elevated version of what I had at my friend’s places growing up and while I appreciated the nostalgia, I felt as if there was no climax to the meal after all the crescendo. I will say that I needed the bulk of the soup and rice to make me full.

While I thought the desserts were good, I think that Oiji Mi’s are better.

They offered to prepare paella and bone marrow … OMG, it was the best food ever ever.

My 7 guests and I loved the atmosphere - it was chic, intimate and perfectly unpretentious.

Huge thank you to Ana at Bacaro for being so accommodating and securing the private dining room (Lido) last minute for us. Ana’s quick email responses to the changes and questions I had just 1 day out from my event were very much appreciated. Anywhere you could have sat in the restaurant would have been beautiful but this was extra special (the one and only thing I would suggest is considering a small speaker in the private room for some background ambience but that’s very minor).

Everything from the service to the food to the cocktails and wine was amazing.

The food and drink options are great, but the service needs some work.
For appetizers, we ordered the Zucchini Blossoms (good, but a tad bland), the Green bean salad (flavorful and refreshing), Fritto Misto (interesting mix of calamari and shrimp), Spaghetti Nero (very fascinating), Garlic Shrimp over Polenta (quite good but wasn't amazing), Eggplant Marinara (quite tasty and flavorful), and the Tiramisu (was straight out of the refrigerator, felt a bit firm). All in all, the food was quite good but lacked the wow factor.
The service needs some improvement - I recognize that it was a busy night, but the interactions could have been better (their response to our question about the specials could have been handled better - they didn't have any, but the way they responded was odd, they brought out our entrees while we were still working on appetizers and the small tables couldn't accommodate all the plates).

We finished our food in like 15mins and ready to leave, we asked for a check and at the end we gave a 18% tips. The same waitress came to look at the receipt, look dissatisfied, yelled at us how we have five people and give so little tips. One of us then just left $20 cash on top of it to get us out of the situation. Though I disagree with how we resolve it. I think it’s disturbing for the waitress to call us out on how much we should be tipping when she did perform an excellent customer service. She would be rated negative 2 out of 5 stars.

Here’s what we got:
Grande Nachos
Crispy Pescado 🌮
Jackfruit Carnitas 🌮
Esquites
Coconut Coquito

Kid’s Menu: comes with a drink
Build Your Own Taco
Chico Burrito
Ninos Nachos

Dessert:
Chocolate Chip Cookies
Churritos

The Grande Nachos can be shared or purchased as your entree because it is filling.
We got tacos which come as a pair: the Crispy Pescado tasted crispy and “fish” like, so good; the Jackfruit Carnitas were flavorful.  We are corn lovers, so to find a vegan street style roasted corn was something to look forward to; the Esquites did not disappoint.
Coconut Coquito tasted delicious, being vegan for some years now, we haven’t found anything like it.

Our kids enjoyed making their tacos. The burrito was a good kid size. Ninos Nachos was too much for them to handle because they were full, however  they finished it because it was delicious.

If you don’t order anything else, make sure to order the Churritos!! They were crispy, soft, and the perfect amount of sweet with the dulce de leche.
The Cookies came in a pack of 4, which was perfect for our kids to share. It tasted almost like a scone.

most people order from the hot food bar where you can pick and choose whatever is on display and prepared that day. the dishes rotate daily, so it's not the same choices every day. the food, here, is exceedingly good for the price. last time i was here--i got the special which is three sides over rice and got curried chicken and vegetables, fried batter fish, and bokchoy. the serving is ample and you get a lot of each side as well as rice. the rice was fluffy and tasted fresh bc the turnover is high so they constantly have to make more. the chicken curry and veggies was really flavorful. and the fried battered fish was crunchy and savory. definitely a great place to try if you're hungry and want a variety of eats on one plate. the special of three sides over rice  is $7.50 + tip.

Very intimate date spot. The seats were sooo tiny but I don’t expect much else from NYC. We got some white wine & food. Everything was so delicious!

Food Ordered: Daisy mandarins with moscatel and smoked cheese, fried sourdough with chickpeas and crab, half chicken with piri piri and French fries.

My favorite was the chicken - it was seasoned so well & the aioli was also fantastic. The fries were crispy - just like how I like them. The sourdough dish was a close second - the chickpeas were crispy & the whole dish was full of flavor. The mandarins were good too, but a simpler dish.

As always, the ambiance and service were top-notch. One standout feature for me is their coat racks; it's a rarity to find a place that takes care of your winter coats, ensuring a comfortable dining experience without bulky outerwear.

Our culinary journey began with the pea shoots and watercress salad with goat cheese, which our server highly recommended. Regrettably, it didn't quite meet our expectations. The goat cheese overwhelmed the dish, leaving it unsatisfying.

However, things took a delightful turn with the green tomato and fried rock shrimp dish and the porcini rice with razor clams. The horseradish flavor, combined with thinly sliced tomatoes and perfectly cooked shrimp, was a true delight. The porcini rice was a burst of flavors, complementing the clams beautifully.

The much-loved lamb burger with a side of fries lived up to its reputation. The lamb was impeccably cooked, rendering it juicy and tender. On the other hand, the sea bream a la plancha fell slightly short, as it appeared a touch too salty, possibly due to an excess of lemon.

Our meal concluded with flan, which, unfortunately, left me disappointed. It resembled more of a cheesecake and left a bitter aftertaste.

I ordered a noodle with meat and vegetable sauce. The sauce was good and didn't feel anything like spicy or something while the noodles when served hot were enjoyable, I guess they had shredded pork meat in that sauce. Overall a good experience but the quantity could have been better.

Another one was supposed to be veg pancake but unfortunately they were out of it so got replaced by veg dumping. The dumpling has cabbage, ginger and a bit of onion as the filling, wish they had given soy sauce on the side and it would have been better.

The food was bland and uninspired, lacking any semblance of flavor or creativity. It was as if the chef had given up halfway through preparing each dish.

To add insult to injury, the service was abysmal. The waitress I encountered was not only rude but seemed utterly disinterested in providing even basic assistance. When I politely requested some hot sauce, she curtly informed me that I would have to fetch it myself from the counter on the other side of the restaurant. Excuse me? Last time I checked, I was a paying customer, not a fetch-and-carry lackey. The sheer audacity of her response left me speechless.

The service was excellent as soon as we walked in we were asked about our bags and coats. The dinner staff were also attentive throughout the meal and made sure we had everything we needed.

The food was, I'd say, okay especially for $90 a person (for the prix fixe menu). I thought the best, most memorable dish was the smoked lamb pappardelle and the roasted cabbage dish. The gelato for desert was also pretty great. The shrimp with black garlic was a big let down. The full shell-on shrimp didn't do anything for me and it was smeared in a black garlic paste that I had to remove and then place back on the shrimp AFTER I removed the shell to have the proper bite - not a fan of when restaurants do this.

We were a group of 5 and had a reservation for 7:30PM. I'm a bit conflicted on how to rate the service as the sign said we had 90 minutes to dine, but we were basically rushed out by 8:30PM.

Definitely didn't make us feel too great, so we paid quickly and left to find another spot to get more food/drinks.

- Raw tuna
- String beans

Used to come here pretty often due to the nice selection of noodles available along with its great location. I understand that there are ‘off’ nights with Chefs and staff but unfortunately there were issues with the food the last 3 visits I had over the last month. I order essentially the same thing everytime- Last night got the stir fry shrimp meifun, which upon opening was gummy in texture with excess liquid along the bottom of the plate. Then this was followed by an odd, almost sour taste along with some noodles that were not fully cooked. For $14.14 (cc fee included) this was inedible. Unfortunately the quality of the noodles seems to have worsened continuously over the last year. I’d stick to the noodle soup if you visit or go else where in Chinatown for stir fry noodles (especially with this comparatively mid-higher end price point).

Main meats were pork, miyazaki wagyu, and washugyu, with different sauces and combinations + some palette cleansing pieces in between. Loved every single item we were served, with a very strong final dessert - sesame icecream (which I would buy tubs of, in a heartbeat if they ever sold it!!!)

Take note:
- They will cook everything for you, and so you will be served in small omakase plated style
- Drink selection is great and pairs really nicely with the food
- If you’re used to salty, strong seasoned food, you may find this too “delicate” or bland. But it was perfect for me, and what I think Japanese shabushabu should be like. Felt like the good, fresh ingredients were respected and well prepared.

I don’t usually eat red meat, but we went for my boyfriend’s birthday — all I gotta say is that Wagyu MELTS in your mouth. Wow.

I appreciated getting to taste each on its own first, before we had different variations (with different sauces). The fact that it’s all cooked right in front of you, in such an intimate setting (8 seats — make a res, y’all), is pretty cool too. And the two women running the show are skilled and kind.

I eat a lot (arguably more than my boyfriend) and get disappointed when an omakase leaves me hungry. Happy to report that we both left feeling full!

In the land where the ocean meets the sky,
My heart seeks sushi, that's no lie.

A harmony of tastes, a symphony of delight,
In each delicate roll, every delectable bite.

Rice, seaweed, with salmon's blush,
A love so profound, it makes me hush.

Wasabi's warmth, ginger's cool,
Every piece, a glistening jewel.

Sweetly whispers the tender eel,
In every slice, love's a tactile feel.
