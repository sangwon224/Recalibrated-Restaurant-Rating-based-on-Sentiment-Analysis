The steamed dumplings were fresh, hot and mega tasty.
Lovely friendly staff and patrons alike - such a great vibe!",5
2,Ear Inn,"326 Spring St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.5,Srinivasan S,"This is a great place with a bit of history. The drinks were good, and their menu is shot and precise. We went there around 9 p.m., where the crowd was spilling outside. But we were called back in within 10 min as tables cleared. The drinks were good, the wings were great. The burgers were ok.",5
3,Ear Inn,"326 Spring St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.5,w brewer,"They happily accommodated my party of 8 visitors from UK-everyone liked the food and the service was friendly. The shepherds pie was awesome! If you like an old school pub feel and don't mind it being a bit warm (no ac?), this is a unique NYC spot.",5
4,Ear Inn,"326 Spring St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.5,ReedH,Nothing fancy and no exotic beers on tap but it is a great little dive bar that‚Äôs still worth a visit for the history alone. The guys behind the bar are a friendly crew and will keep your pint full. And the food isn‚Äôt bad either - I had the garlic shrimp as a starter and a burger and both were solid. I‚Äôd go back if I were in the area.,4
5,Ear Inn,"326 Spring St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.5,Pey C,Amazing vibes!!! It gets crowded easily but the waitresses are very attentive. My friend and I had a great time. We both had burgers and very juicy. Definitely will come back again.,5
6,Lindens,"2 Renwick St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.8,Ethan Castillo,"TLDR; this is a simple yet fine dine experience, great service and the food is delicious.

Linden‚Äôs is a chic and very simple restaurant that is beautifully accentuated by the decoration and wide open spaces. The food service is exceptional and the waiters are very knowledgeable and courteous. After every plate, we were brought new silverware and our table was wiped off. The waiters were very tentative to refill our glasses and would bring us another bottle of water promptly.

The food service was quick, we didn‚Äôt have to wait very long for it to come out nice and hot. We were here twice and ordered the pancakes, the avocado toast, the carrot ravioli, the giardiniera with pita bread, the burgers and the strawberry tart. All was super delicious and the waiters checked on us periodically to make sure that we were satisfied.

It was our anniversary and Isaiah (the manager) made it very special for my wife and I- the both times we visited! A very well spoken gentleman, made sure to check up on us throughout our visits. Definitely elevated the experience tenfold. We are very grateful for the wonderful service we received from Isaiah, our waiters and Zeury at the front desk. Zeury takes great pictures, loves taking them and she is just the sweetest! My wife loved her. We will definitely be returning in the near future.

Also, if you leave a note when making a reservation: they read EVERYTHING. This restaurant alone made our NY trip well worth it.",5
7,Lindens,"2 Renwick St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.8,Carol Broughton,"We were greeted by the warm, friendly host who went above and beyond to make my daughter‚Äôs birthday celebration extra special. Our server Dan was exceptional. He made great suggestions and brought each course out at the perfect time. My daughter was surprised withe birthday celebration. The food and service were impeccable. The restaurant atmosphere was warm, friendly and the decor was very nice. I highly recommend this place.",5
8,Lindens,"2 Renwick St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.8,Mandy Kuo,"Good lunch spot with coworkers close to Tribeca area. Everyone liked the sharing items we got, especially the house roll and kale pita. My colleague really liked his gnocchi which was fluffy and crispy. The green bowl I got was a bit underwhelming with just mixed greens like a full salad. Service was attentive and efficient.",5
9,Lindens,"2 Renwick St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.8,Shabnam Rezaei,I don‚Äôt give 5 stars. This place is a real gem. I stopped in here casually for a quick Saturday brunch with my daughter. The decor is nice and the staff if ok. The food was absolutely heavenly. We tried the avocado toast and the a√ßa√≠ bowl. They were both delicious with fresh ingredients. My coffee with almond milk was also yum! Would definitely go back for something casual when in the hood. Prices are on the high side. Go!,4
10,Lindens,"2 Renwick St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.8,Keya Bellare,"I went to Lindens for lunch with a friend. The space was large and had a lot of natural light. Service was friendly and quick.

We ordered the honey butternut squash ravioli and spicy sausage pizza. Both of us felt that the ravioli was too sweet, but the pizza was very well balanced. I ordered a latte at the end of my meal which was served with biscotti - a nice surprise treat!",4

Really should have stopped going a long time ago but have to draw a hard line at LIVING SPIDER.

13,Essen Fast Slow Food,"160 Varick St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.1,XDF,"I often go for lunch during the week - there is an unmatched variety of food to choose from that can satisfy any craving. Gets pretty crazy during the breakfast and lunch rushes, but moves fast enough to where you aren't waiting forever. A bit on the pricier side in my opinion, but 100% worth it. I have gotten some of my best and fastest meals from here.",5
14,Essen Fast Slow Food,"160 Varick St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.1,Analie Fernandez,"I love this place ‚ù§Ô∏è There's a lot of choices  for your hearty  breakfast, or lunch, and or dinner!üòçüòò A buffet hot food, a cold cuts, smoothie bar, salad bar,  pastries, and soups area,  and varieties of coffee and milk and creams in their coffee bar__but, I always go for half & half for my dark roast coffee, and a lot moreüëç(see pics) üòò They have mezzanine seating area inside and  few 2-sitter tables outside, on the sidewalk--so,I guess, it is Essen & the sidewalk tables? ‚ò∫Ô∏è

I gave them 5 stars because the place is neat and clean and you have so many choices what to eat for the day and they have a good seating area.

15,Essen Fast Slow Food,"160 Varick St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.1,Michael Ostuni,I have the salad bar and I thought it was just decent. Everything seem to be a little bit oily but it is fresh. It is also quite pricey but I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll find anything cheaper this area. Not a bad place to stop for some healthy food. The place is very clean,4
16,La Sir√®ne Soho,"558 Broome St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.5,Nat Cooper,"Marion, the server, is the best. This place is truly a hidden gem in SoHo. There is not one miss on the whole menu. Recommend the goat cheese tart and the hanger steak which arrives in a bath of garlic and butter. Do not skip dessert. This feels like one of those bistros in France where you can just hang with the owner and chat for hours. I love this spot.",5
17,La Sir√®ne Soho,"558 Broome St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.5,Pete Basica,"For NYC this place is a bargain. A $95 pre-fixe Valentines Day dinner is a steal.

The Foie Gras is delicate, subtle, extremely well done.

I have no idea how they make pureed carrots so damn good.

The mains and dessert are well prepared and the coffee americano is perfect.",5

19,La Sir√®ne Soho,"558 Broome St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.5,J W,"La Sirene will always be our favorite French restaurant in NYC. Let me lay out all the reasons why:

Service - 5*
Marty is what I would call the perfect waiter. He's friendly, easily to talk to, and provided exceptional service to ensure we had a wonderful dining experience, from cleaning up the bread crumbs to checking-in to see if we like our food, to simply having a pleasant conversation that wasn't too abrupt or too long, it was simply enjoyable and heartwarming. If I had a restaurant of my own, Marty is the type of server I wish I could hire. The other waiters are also exceptional and friendly as well!

Ambiance - 4*
The restaurant is indeed very beautiful and warm, but some of the tables are very small; although it provides an intimate experience, it sometimes felt as if our food overwhelmed the table and made it a bit tight. The seating is also kind of too close, where we felt as if we were dining with the table next to us. However, I'm sure a little rearranging can fix this issue with no problem!

Food - 5*
Escargot - consistently fresh and tasty, with a perfect blend of garlic, butter, and parsley! The sauce remaining paired beautifully with the complimentary bread so remember to save some of the bread! It is a bit pricy though, averaging around 4 dollars per piece.

French onion soup - crispy cheese adding a pleasant bite to the soup! Very flavorful and the different textures are beautifully interwoven, providing a delightful and heartwarming experience!

Hanger steak - incredibly tender and it paired perfectly with the sauce, which has a nice balance between its savoriness and the truffle infused in it! Definitely a good choice for steak!

Cassoulet - My favorite dish of all time at La Sirene! Incredibly filling and rich, with a blend of fattiness from the duck, sausage, bacon, and chicken infused with the soft beans and veggies! The breadcrumbs also provide a very playful crunch that enhanced the entire dish as well! If you get this, chances are you're guaranteed to be full, so be careful you don't over order! This dish used to be served to warriors, so that's just a little fun fact that also made me love this dish more! A perfect winter dish!

Overall, I am so happy that La Sirene has always been so consistent in its exemplary service and heartwarming entrees! Highly recommend coming here for a nice comforting dinner, whether it's with family or with your soulmate!

Thank you for reading and best of luck! (:",5

30,Tauro,"284 Hudson St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.4,Arielle H,Delicious lemonade and stew chicken.  Rice and beans packed with flavor.  I wish I could say the same for the baked chicken it was dry and seasonless but that was the only bad part.  Other than that the staff are nice and majority of the food is yummy and worth it as they serve probably the best food in the food desert neighborhood for sure.,4

They kind of threw a table on the corner for us in a spot behind a big party and we didn‚Äôt have our order taken for a while but it was busy. It‚Äôs a fun place to go with friends. We had a dog as well which was fine. Food was very good, especially loved the escargot",4
37,Felix,"340 W Broadway, New York, NY 10013, USA",3.6,Y S,"We booked for brunch on Sunday.  The waiter was so rushing to accommodate any walk-in that they neglected to provide the basic service.  They changed the orientation of our table halfway through our meal.  They refused to take our appetizers order before the main and brough out the main before we were even done with our appetizers and tried to take our dish away. On top of that, the fries were old and fried in old oil. The steak was decent but didn't make up for all the other issues with the service.",3

39,Felix,"340 W Broadway, New York, NY 10013, USA",3.6,Manuel Contreras,"You come here to party on Sunday. By far the best place to be on that date. Just super hard to land a table or even get in unless you know someone and book in advance. Even then, they will not honor your reservations.

40,Felix,"340 W Broadway, New York, NY 10013, USA",3.6,Marion NYC,This is a great place for people watching even now during COVID.  Street is busy with people.  Service was friendly.  Casual and laid back vibe with music in the background.  Oysters were surprisingly good.  East coast oysters.  Mussels were just ok. A little overcooked.  The steak was ok but seemed like it was cook over something before cleaning the grill.  Just seemed like there was a flavor different than the meat.  This is more for a good neighborhood soho restaurant for being in the ‚Äúscene‚Äù but food was just okay.  Wine was good.  Bread was ok.  Bottomless water :),4

46,Black Burger,"386 Canal St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.4,Nicolas Rosselot Urrejola (Nico Rosselot),"I recently had an exceptional lunch at Black Burger on Canal St in Manhattan. The experience was truly memorable, highlighted by their signature double black burger with cheese. The burger was cooked to perfection, medium rare, just as I requested, and each bite was a delightful blend of flavors and textures. The curly fries were a perfect side dish, wonderfully crunchy and well-seasoned. Despite the restaurant's small size and limited seating, the quality of the food more than compensates, making it a hidden gem in the area. This place is a must-visit for anyone craving a top-tier burger in an unassuming setting. The combination of delicious food, high velocity city atmosphere, and friendly service makes it stand out in the bustling Manhattan food scene.",5

This is where I get my fix. There is no hesitation from behind the counter with any requests. Let‚Äôs toast a plain donut for the bun, throw some sliced beets, and grape leaves in there, on and on.

They were kind of surprised when I asked even though it‚Äôs in the menu. Then to top it off, they let a  grifter (not homeless) walk around harassing people for money and commenting on their clothes. 2 stars because I get what they‚Äôre trying to do with the crazy low $3 for 2 sides and a drink.

It's too good. It is probably the most satisfying slice of pizza i have ever eaten. It is way too good to be only a dollar. I honestly am convinced there is some sort of magical cocaine adjacent taste enhancing drug in this pizza or they have some magical underpaid pizza fairy in the back sprinkling goodness on each slice, it is just way, way, waaay too good. I feel like a little Italian boy eating my grandmothers pizza fresh from the oven in the Italian countryside. I have literally zero connection to Italy, but somehow, this is how I feel. I wish I could give this majestic establishment six stars, I don't know how they do it but this place is honestly the greatest and most precious sanctuary left of reasonably priced pizza in this city and it has honestly changed my worldview.",5

As a regular customer, I appreciate the convenience of its Canal Street location, especially after crossing the Holland Tunnel from New Jersey. The affordability combined with the delicious taste makes this spot stand out.",5

The burger was really tasty. I would order again for sure. The winner was the shake, it tasted much better than an overly sugared shake. It had a good sweetness but was not too rich at all and tasted so fresh.

76,Vestry,"246 Spring St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.1,Laura Lacy,"My partner and I decided to treat ourselves to a date night yesterday and we are still talking about our experience. We were greeted with warmth and sat at a lovely corner table facing the entire restaurant. The environment was classy and comfortable featuring soft cozy seating (which is lacking in some upscale spots) which set the tone for relaxation and immediately made us excited to scan the menu. We started with bread and their house mushroom butter (which I wish I had a case of) followed by tuna tartare that was so flavorful and yet so light as well as the burrata which I highly recommend as a sort of palate cleanser as it is fresh and hums of spring. We indulged in a plate of gnocchi which honestly knocked my socks off and made me sink into my seat (or it could have been the well balanced cocktails we were sipping on - get The Underdog if you like rye). Now we get to the main players which proved to be classic, simple and very well done - the lamb as well as the wagyu. I appreciate that the proteins were featured with delicate reductions and seasonal greenery really honoring the ingredients. We wrapped up the night with a little dessert spread with the sorbet being our favorite and also such a fun presentation. I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt mention the extraordinary service from beginning to end with Sammy being our guide with excellent explanations of all dishes and Adam who set us up and proved to be an accommodating and gracious host.

While the flavors were satisfying, I had hoped for more generous servings, especially considering the prices.

Actually the music was so loud that everyone was yelling at each other at the table, so not the spot if you actually want to have a conversation.

The pasta was good but definitely more Italian American with the heavy seasoning and everything on the saltier side. I preferred the raviolo out of the 2 we ordered.

My favorite was the burrata. It was really nice with the dressing and lots of pistachios to go with it. Love pistachios!

As for the atmosphere, its very cool and chic with great playlist but the music is way way too loud. It fits for people who dont like to talk. And I agree with other reviewers here that we have to shout and yell to each other and that makes the whole place even noisier.

106,Mezzanine,"246 Spring St, New York, NY 10013, USA",3.1,Johnny Novo,"My mother was staying at the Dominick for the week and had $120 a day for breakfast because she's an Amex platinum member or somethin. Yeah, Nanc is like that.

Mezzanine is the breakfast restaurant in the Dominick, and I met her here damn near every morning of her trip, as I'm not one to pass up a free breakfast.

Honestly, this is some of the most insane price gouging I've ever seen in my life. We were CRACKING up when we saw the $9 americano, the $9 coke, the $18 grape fruit. Even for NYC this is insane ahahahaha.

I would get the $42 American Breakfast that comes with 2 eggs, potatoes, cherry tomatoes, turkey bacon, toast, orange juice, and a coffee. Honestly, this was EASILY the most bang for your buck on the menu.

I will be fair, the breakfast did SLAP. Some of the best turkey bacon I've had in a minute. Normally turkey bacon is just a sad excuse for bacon, but this one actually tasted like good bacon. It was bangin.

The orange juice was also AMAZING. One of my simple pleasures in this life is some actual freshly squeezed orange juice. There is nothing like it‚Ä¶ If you just get the OJ though, it's $12 for MAYBE 16 oz. That just threw a sandbag on my excitement ahahha. Not worth it... and they even forget my OJ I had to ask about it twice smh don't play with me and my OJ!

Even if you have Nanc bread, these prices are just laughable. They should change the name of this place to PriceGougeanine.

107,Mezzanine,"246 Spring St, New York, NY 10013, USA",3.1,Nik T,"Nobody attending the check in desk, older white couple walks inside and ignores front desk and gets asked how many, and gets seated. Reception comes back and tells my Asian wife and I that there is a 10 min wait. I say ""that couple came in after us, and you just found them a seat"" and she says sorry there's a wait.

So much for staying here, being guests at the hotel and treating people fairly. Let's see how the food is, but so far 0 stars for service.

UPDATE: Finally seated about 15 minutes later, and that experience carried straight into breakfast. We were seated while two different tables were actively complaining about the service.  I felt better seeing the couple that was seated earlier looking annoyed and having no water or drinks on their table.

We had the impudence to ask for drinks and coffee, and then looked through the menu. A whole, 40+ minutes go by before we get our coffee. Something crazy going on here, over half the food going to tables was being sent back to the kitchen. Not over cooked steaks‚Ä¶things like waffles and pancakes. How is that even possible? Waiters seemed stressed out, but ample people available. One lady just setting and cleaning tables, waiting for people to leave, and setting and cleaning tables. Meanwhile, people don‚Äôt have water and food. Table next to us left without paying the bill. Another table complained and had their meal comped. Absolute dumpster fire, but highly entertaining in that ‚Äúwatching it implode‚Äù kind of way.

Shashuka was good. Medium rare steak was cold and well done, not even sure how that is possible. Chicken sausage has the thickest rubber‚Äôiest casing I‚Äôve ever had, to the point where we were wondering if it was still covered in plastic.

After all this, they have 20% gratuity pre-billed! How is this part of a ‚Äúfive diamond‚Äù hotel? Absolutely ridiculous experience.

To all you trying it out, good luck, god speed, bring an e-book.",1
108,Mezzanine,"246 Spring St, New York, NY 10013, USA",3.1,RGSOUNDF,"(February 2020) Only due to our continuing patronage of The Dominick we decided to give it 3 stars, for with all honesty it deserves 2 stars, best case scenario.
First of all, last time we had our lunch at Cafe Mezz, about 10 months ago, we were seated in the same area where the breakfast is served, featuring two levels and glass walls with more or less direct views, depending on a table. This time around, we were led into a different area (to the left of the levator and not to the right, the breakfast area). Smallish area, only two tables got an access to the windows (Varick St and not Spring St as the breakfast area offers), no tablecloths, dim lighting.
And then the food. Even though the exorbitant prices are the universal plague of all the eateries located inside hotels, but even considering that, $24 for a small plate of spring rolls that normally costs five bucks is an outrageous markup. The Annapolis Jumbo Lump Crab Cake, offered at $24, was a single crab cake instead of customary two.
The service was a sub-quality one, for with close-to-empty dining area, it took the staff over 10 minutes to even approach our table, for both lunch and breakfast.
The breakfast next day was a bit better, the 3-egg omelet was good (you get a choice of two: mushroom, kale, feta, english spinach, green asparagus, arugula, parmesan, blue cheese, cheddar, locally sourced cherry tomatoes, Catsmo smoked salmon, or Benton's country ham; every extra is $4).
The hotel's main restaurant, the former Spring and Varick, has been closed for over one year, its new reincarnation's (Vestry, headed by the Michelin-Starred Chef Shaun Hergatt) opening has been repeatedly postponed, so right now, a much better choice would be to eat out at any of the multiple area's restaurants.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(April 2019) Cafe Mezz is now the place where breakfast and all-day dining is served at the Dominick Hotel (while the hotel's main restaurant, the Spring & Varick is undergoing renovations; scheduled to reopen in September 2019).
To get to Cafe Mezz (also known as Mezzanine) you got to press 'M' in the elevator. The dining area is divided in two: the main level and the step-down lower level. Whether you are in the step-down section or the main part of the Mezzanine, try to get a table by the window; it provides for a much better overall experience.
The service is by and large good, even though not very polished or highly skilled.
As the title goes, our lunch and breakfast experiences were different. The lunch was undoubtedly 5 stars. The food was great and priced on a budget-friendly level, well, for a restaurant located in a 5-star hotel. Every dish we had, from the light and diet-friendly Organic Chicken Soup, to Big Eye Tuna Tartare, from Atlantic Salmon to Spaghetti Pomodoro, everything was prepared right, served neatly and appetizingly, the food was fresh and delicious.
Now, the breakfast affair was a different story. The food was still good, the choices satisfactory, and the preparation and serving were very good. But! The breakfast prices are something that every potential diner should be aware of. While it is a common practice that hotel meals are priced in a quite steep, if not skyrocketing, way, there should be limits. At Mezzanine, every piece of toast and every coffee refill is not free. As a result, our breakfast featuring 2 egg dishes and coffees was $146.43 (including gratuity), whereas our lunch the day before, featuring 2 appetizers and 2 full main courses, not the cheapest at that, was $136.32 (inc. gratuity). This is simply not right. We personally didn't bear the brunt, for we had a $100 dining credit and free breakfast for 2 ($93 value). However, with the existing breakfast pricing policy in place, we would suggest one heads to any of the multiple breakfast joints abundant in the west Soho or north Tribeca.",3

From the quaint and intimate setting, this family run establishment had a charm and authenticity that can‚Äôt be faked. All the food was piping hot, and as fresh as could be imagined. The warm smiling faces and energetic service made you feel right at home. The burrata was supremely fresh and light. The gnocchi was to die for. Literally the best I‚Äôve ever had. And my sister and brother in law have lived in Italy for 20 years. The lemon cheesecake was off the charts good. The lasagna was rich, decadent, yet fluffy and light all at once. The table side tiramisu, while unique and non-traditional, was an experience and explosion of deliciousness. Everything was spot on, from flavor, to presentation, to texture, to freshness. I would honestly consider taking a trip back to NYC just to come back.",5

The special salad was so sweet. The food was plain. However, we were unsatisfied with the service; the food had just arrived and the server came to check if the food was good or not, but we did not have a chance to taste it. The check came with the dessert‚Äîoh my god, does that mean we need to leave now? At least let us finish our food.",3

I had a glass of Sauvignon blanc and he a plain Casamigo soda.  U know that they used the freshest vegetables because I know they only used olive oil and some salt and pepper but the dish really tasted amazing. I actually forgot to take photos lol.

The ribeye steak ‚Äî 8.5/10. Could‚Äôve been a little rarer, a little too well done for my taste. Chimmichurri sauce has the perfect level of spice and goes well with the steak.

I added sausage and they stole my heart when they told me it was sausage crumble and not sliced (HEAVEN) . My order was about $10 , which was not bad for the quality of the pizza. My pizza was served to me on a dish plate, which I thought was a bit fancy and it was absolutely DELICIOUS!! I would have stayed for a second slice but I didn‚Äôt have time.

I‚Äôve actually read some reviews complaining about this, but this person might not know that you need to completely dip your piece of bread in the pot and stir the bottom. Fondue is made of a combination of cheeses, and each have a different density. Therefore, with every bite, you need to stir your cheese in the fondue pot to ensure you‚Äôre picking up all the flavor.

151,Taureau,"558 Broome St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.3,Alyssa C.,"Been coming here for a year and an half and am a frequent visiter (2 to 3 times a month). When I started coming, it really was great. Heavy portions, excellent service. But recently that has changed.

They have changed to an a la carte menu and now does not allow refills for the chocolate dippings. Originally you could get as many refills on the fruits, marshmallows and cakes as your chocolate needs. But now you finish your dippings and there‚Äôs a quarter of the chocolate left. So unless you‚Äôre paying extra for the dippings, your sol. It‚Äôs ridiculous.

Additionally, the last 3 times I‚Äôve gone to taureau, the cake they serve is ridiculously dry, hard and yesterday was burnt. The first time I received bad cake, it was so hard I could beat the cake on the plate and it would not break. I showed the waiter and he took it away. At this time, you could get refills on other things. The second time, you could not get the refills. So he gave me some more strawberries. The third time, yesterday I was given fresher cake since the cake was literally burnt. I don‚Äôt understand why I would be served literal burnt black cake (the burnt cake being the white cake‚Ä¶ no excuse for a darker color) when there were fresher pieces.

Additionally, yesterdays service was less than usual. It was the most busy time I have ever seen the restaurant (5 tables) but I do expect good service given the price and my level of frequency. Whenever there are large tables, you get neglected as a smaller table. This has happened to me multiple times at the restaurant. Often times salad and bread refills take longer (8/9 minutes), but wine being served, orders being taken for the larger tables, items being given to the other tables, etc. Never being asked how the food is. Having to ask for water, salad, bread refills as they waitress passes the table and never stops by. Having to wait 10/15 minutes for the bill to come.

Given the amount of money the restaurant has made with my patronage (cheese and chocolate fondue for 2, wine, cheese dippings every time and occasionally filet mignon additional course), I would expect not to be served hard, dry nor burnt cake nor would I expect less than good service. I know all these waiters/waitresses, and 20 percent tip is ALWAYS given when I go. I am additionally disappointed the refills for the fondue were taken away. Hopefully it is better the next time I adventure out to you guys. :(",3
152,Taureau,"558 Broome St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.3,James Jakubowski,"This place is a staple for a great long night out, highly suggest! Always going with the full three course option which gives you cheese fondue with bread and salad, a protein course cooked in red wine broth, and finally a delicious chocolate course.

The prices may seem pretty high at first and then you realise it is more of an experience than any other sit down restaurant. You actually get to share the time together with whoever you have gone with, dipping or cooking your own meal together while indulging. This is totally a different experience than getting the meal placed in front of you and you eat and leave. You can easily spend two hours here if they let you on a non-busy night.

Food is great, ambiance is nice, and the price is fair. Definitely would suggest checking out Taureau!",5

As someone who‚Äôs not so big on Greek food except if directly from Greece üá¨üá∑ itself, this place has quality food choices period‚ÄºÔ∏è

By now, since this wasn‚Äôt my first time here, I can almost say I‚Äôve eaten every appetizer available on the menu ü§£ today me and my pals had a buffet style dinner of continuous food.

Each appetizer, including new things I had never tasted, melted in my mouth with deliciousness.  üëåüèæ

The staff overall were pleasant and our servers could have been more attentive but‚Ä¶ nothing to be sour about. It‚Äôs never easy to tend to large crowds of people with various demands at each turn.

The food here is a MUST have! This place has been a staple of soho for years, and it‚Äôs no wonder why ü§©

Thanks for another YUMMY dinner!

The appetizers we tried were the tuna tartare, chicken gyro bao buns and saganaki fondue. All were amazing! My main course was the salmon and I can‚Äôt describe how good it was because my vocabulary is limited. But anyway, once again the service was amazing.

The room lacks any scale and grandeur and the interior design is just too safe, crowd pleasing and underwhelming. This makes the experience feel a little like the you‚Äôre shopping at the Banana Republic of fine dining. The team does try to pull out all the stops with beautiful china, synchronized plate presentations, a lot of hand poured sauces at the table, an excellent wine list, even a digestif cart - but overall it just doesn‚Äôt quite have the magic.",4

The presentation of the dishes was exquisite, and the majority of the food was fresh and flavorful. The only slight drawback was the 90-minute time limit, which I was unaware of beforehand. We were just savoring the last bite of our dessert when we were informed of the time constraint. Additionally, a few of the dishes were a bit too salty for our taste, so we were unable to finish them. Despite these minor issues, the staff was incredibly friendly and attentive.",4

The eggplant dish was fun to eat, with many ways to combine the individual parts. I won't spoil the fun of discovering it.

The only disappointment was the eel, which I actually ordered on the side since I'm a big fan, but it felt flatter compared to everything else.

The service was good and the space was very airy. I went early so there were very few people at the tables.",5

it‚Äôs so hard to even try choosing which course was best. The donburi and seared amberjack were very memorable, and the scallops were very close behind. The steak dish with truffle sauce was to die for and each sashimi piece was so fresh sweet. Some of the sweetest and creamiest Hokkaido uni i‚Äôve had as well.

It was pretty empty when we got there but it was packed by the time we left. They're very quick with getting out everything from drinks to food. I had the rock shrimp, daisy dukes roll, and irony wine. Everything was really good! I liked when we arrived that they gave us a hot towel and a small noodle dish which was really good.",5

For rolls we had (in order of our favorites): Puff the Magic Dragon, The rainbow (which was GREAT because you can chose the base you want on your roll) and then the pink lady (the pink lady wasn't a bad roll we just felt like there were more exciting things we wish we had ordered).

They do a lot of takeout so service was a little slow but our waitress was super attentive.",4

They figured I didn‚Äôt like my pasta just by my facial expression and came to the table to check in.  I don‚Äôt eat pork, and there was pork cheek in my pasta. And as soon as I tasted it, I got confused. I didn‚Äôt read the menu good enough.
So the server said, ‚Äúno this pasta isn‚Äôt it for you‚Äù with a kind tone and asked me what I would like to have instead. I got a replacement quickly after.
My colleagues and I were pleasantly surprised.

I enjoyed the cucumber salad and the brussel sprouts.

For my entree I got the steak frites and it was good and flavorful.

The pulpo and calamari appetizers were perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor. For our entrees, we indulged in the lasagna and linguini, both of which were incredibly satisfying and expertly prepared.

217,Altesi Downtown,"200 Spring St, New York, NY 10012, USA",4.3,Safi Bi,"I had a company holiday dinner here and my team was very excited to come here after hearing great things about it.

Location: the location is great and right on Spring street off the E train. If you get out on the Spring street exit the restaurant is across the street.

Atmosphere: we had our holiday dinner on Tuesday and aside from 2-3 other customers we were the only ones there. Our table seated about 12 people.

Food and drinks: We ordered a few drinks and they had virgin drinks/alcoholic drinks but plenty to choose from. They were pretty good.

For appetizers we ordered Polpo which was the grilled octopus with potatoes, capers, olives and red onions. This was delicious and the olives and capers added so much flavor to the dish. We also ordered Carciofi alla Giudia which is artichoke hearts with parsley sauce and this is a MUST have. All of my coworkers really liked this.

For mains I ordered the Branzino and the serving was pretty small. I‚Äôm not a big eater but even for me this on the smaller size. It was also on the sweeter size and I thought it lacked a little flavor.

My husband also came and he ordered the dry aged angus steak. He asked medium rare and they brought it out well done so he wasn‚Äôt too thrilled with it.

We order dessert and I got three chocolate mousse which was incredible.

My coworkers thought their food was just ok.

Since it was a holiday dinner we did have fun and enjoyed our time there but if I came here on a date and the food wasn‚Äôt as expected I wouldn‚Äôt be too happy.",4

The place has a really cool interior with warm colors and a soft light that creates a great atmosphere.
The service was top-notch too.
We had an antipasto and then an amazing pizza on a thin crust. My favorite dish was the polpo and altesi antipasto with lobster! My husband had lasagna and loved it. The desserts were delicious too, with a nice tiramisu at the end.",5
219,Altesi Downtown,"200 Spring St, New York, NY 10012, USA",4.3,J Z (Captain Z),"The food here was very disappointing.

We read the reviews and researched this place. On paper it looked like a place in line with what we really enjoy.

The restaurant is beautiful. The staff was amazing. The food, quite honestly, was just not that good at all.

We ordered two appetizers: tuna tartare and meatballs. The presentation of both dishes was beautiful, but the taste did not match the look.

The tuna tartare was flat, and tasteless, overwhelmed by the over-sized portion of avocado. The meatballs tasted like an old dish rag. The marinara sauce was almost flavorless. Even the breadbasket with small scraps of bread and a tasteless spread was underwhelming.

We decided not to stay for the main course. I can't remember the last time we've done that.

Bottom line - the place is very nice. The service was great, but you go to a restaurant for good food. This place just doesn't have it.

Go somewhere else.",2

223,Maison Close Restaurant,"15 Watts St, New York, NY 10013, USA",4.8,R Karagiannis,"The service is IMPECCABLE. The waiters are fun, attentive, caring and invested in everyone having a great time. I mean they even would bring our drinks and phones to us if we were dancing. I had to step to the side to answer an email and our waiter came by to check on me and make sure everything was ok!! On top of that they are fun, keep the energy high, and dance on chairs.

The burlesque show is short, but fun and surprising. Right after the show the party starts. If you want to drink, dance and be home by 7pm, this is your spot.

Now the downside‚Ä¶ the food is really really bad and super expensive. The lobster is tough and rubber, the croissant is dry, and the French fries were soggy. NOT worth the exorbitant prices.

The show starts between 3:30-4:00. So, I recommend making a reservation for 3-3:30, getting some drinks and maybe a snack for the table.",4

Each dish was a masterpiece. Seafood tower is a must-try, ribeye steak melts in your mouth, truffle linguine is a game-changer and the escargot is simply the best I‚Äôve ever had.

Ambiance is sophisticated from the moment you walk through the door, with elegant decor and a staff that effortlessly combines professionalism with warmth.

Seriously, the service is on point. No stiff formality here; they guide you through the menu like seasoned pros, making sure your dining experience is exceptional.

Maison Close nails the upscale French dining game in NYC. It's not just a restaurant; it's a whole experience of culinary excellence that you won't forget.",5
