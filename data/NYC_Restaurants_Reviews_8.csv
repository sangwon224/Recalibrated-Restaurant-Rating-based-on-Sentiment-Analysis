1,Crif Dogs,"113 St Marks Pl, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.4,Christian Garcia,Great spot for hot dogs!   My only complaint about this spot is that the music is TOO LOUD!!  You can't have a conversation.   The hot dogs are deep fried and taste great.   They have a pork/beef blen (Frankfurter) and a NYer that's all beef.   Try out the Chili dog.   That was my favorite!!,4
2,Crif Dogs,"113 St Marks Pl, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.4,janny kim,The wait was 2 hours for the speak easy place. So we tried the food up front. I got the chili dog and my partner got the Philly tube. His was okay mine was better with some extra toppings you can get customized. Def good :) but I think this place is more about the experience,4
3,Crif Dogs,"113 St Marks Pl, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.4,Kishor Bhat,"Veggie dog is nothing to celebrate, so I'm quite surprised it showed up in multiple lists raving about its quality. You will need something to drink if you order the tots! Lady behind the counter seemed grumpy about life.",3

6,A10 Kitchen,"162 Avenue A, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.6,Shivaun McGuckin,"Had a great night here in early April. Sat at the bar, superb service from Grace and Florian and they were so personable - making conversation and chatting to them all night. I definitely made the most of the $7 Happy Hour Spicy Margaritas, so much so that I probably should have gone for the $21 pitcher ü§£ while my husband drank beer. We didn‚Äôt really eat - other than gorgeous pretzel bites - but the food that other people ordered looked really good. It was the first night of our trip and a great way to start. Would definitely recommend.",5
7,A10 Kitchen,"162 Avenue A, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.6,Christi Balaki,Amazing happy hour but be prepared to wait. The mojito (5/5) which was only $6 was extremely strong and had wonderful flavor. The Mac n cheese (5/5) is heavenly for only $5. The pretzel bites (4/5) while good were not worth the $10 with the cheese. I'd pass and get the Mac n cheese next time.,5
8,A10 Kitchen,"162 Avenue A, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.6,Zoe Scourtes,"Been coming to A10 for happy hour for a while now but they recently raised their prices which was disappointing. Besides that, they have a really nice outdoor seating that doesn't feel like you're right on Avenue A with nice booths and heating in the winter. They are also pretty accommodating for groups of 6 or so. The most recent time I went it was 80 F in the city so it was really busy and they gave us a time limit. I recommend if it's warm to make a reservation so you have a better chance of getting in with no time limit. The food specials for happy hour are pretty good and taste really good. The burger used to be $10 and is now $12 which is sad. Everything is going up. Overall, pretty good drinks and food. Not too strong though for the pitchers.",5
9,A10 Kitchen,"162 Avenue A, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.6,Natalie,Went on NYE. It wasn‚Äôt crowded at all we were seated right away. I got the salmon with mashed potatoes and my boyfriend got steak and mashed potatoes. The food was good we both enjoyed it. We also had the watermelon martini which we both enjoyed.,4
10,A10 Kitchen,"162 Avenue A, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.6,Ria S.,"Came Tuesday night with no reservation 15 minutes from happy hour ending, but the host was able to accommodate us at the bar. Super lively, even on a Tuesday, and the happy hour deals are unbeatable. We got a Mango Mojito Pitcher for $20, which split between two people easily gave us 2.5/3 drinks each. To soak up the drinks, we ordered the Mac and cheese, which is insanely cheesy. The bartender was definitely on our side trying to get our orders in before happy hour ended. Great time, will be back for sure!",5
11,Paquitos,"143 1st Ave., New York, NY 10003, USA",4.4,Kirsten Chong,"Really delicious food! Super flavorful. The black beans have a smoky taste to it which I loved.

12,Paquitos,"143 1st Ave., New York, NY 10003, USA",4.4,Dwight Kenneth,Really good portion tacos. Decent price. Staff was super friendly which was the best part. Nothing really stood out. Would have wished there was more onions on the tacos so there was more contrast in flavor and textures. The smoked brisket taco was really good and the meat was really tender. Would happily come back.,3
13,Paquitos,"143 1st Ave., New York, NY 10003, USA",4.4,tyler nagel,"My favorite spot for burritos in the city. My gym used to be in the area and I would always have a  craving for good Mexican cuisine. My search for something filling where I can pack in a lot of calories after grueling workouts ended at the doorstep of Paquitos.

Their burritos are bigger than my forearms, and that's before you add in the lettuce and tomatoes they put on the side. I most commonly do the combo, carnitas, and suadero burritos, all delicious choices. I personally opt for diving right in and getting a little messy, but I've had friends who dissect the big burrito with a fork and knife.

They have a nice punch card loyalty system, and although seating is limited, the restaurant will probably have a soccer game on, with some Spanish music blessing your ears. If you are looking to enjoy the outdoors, Tompkins Sq. park is a short walk away. They are open till midnight, and out of all the restaurants I know that are open that late, none give me more enjoyment than Paquitos!",5
14,Paquitos,"143 1st Ave., New York, NY 10003, USA",4.4,Charlie O'Neill,Local spot with small storefront. Big menu. Food came out really fast. Ordered the steak burrito and it was so delicious. Staff was friendly and I will be going back very soon. Had a lunch special that looked pretty good. Took credit card no problem. Mexican soda was a bit expensive (2.75) but always worth it. Gracias a todos!,5

got ‚ÄúScooby Doo‚Äù sandwich, which is chicken cutlet hero with bacon, jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. the sandwich was fine/okay but it had way too much mayo for me, in general but it was solid. however the real winner was the curly fries i ordered, too. the fries were nice, crunchy, and not greasy. carby fried goodness. the ‚ÄúScooby Doo‚Äù sandwich was $8ish and the curly fries were $4.

The guy was nice. The pizza‚Ä¶ should be better. Crust, cheese: fine. Sauce is a problem. It‚Äôs sweet and gluey; minimal tang. Also, I had a fresh mozzarella slice and a plain slice, and the FM‚Äôs sauce was way sweeter, which flies in the face of taste logic. If this is the only spot open, it IS better than no pizza. If Artichoke is open‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a little better for a little more money. If Tutto Mia is open, walk a couple blocks for one of the best slices in New York at any hour.",3

44,Empanada Mama East Village (14th St),"239 1st Ave., New York, NY 10003, USA",4.2,Karena M,"I really like this place.
Since i started traveling to this area, they have had that Grand Opening sign outside so I'm unsure of exactly when it opened.

The place itself is tiny. I appreciate that they have self service machines to place your orders. It helps those of us who rather explore the menu on our own and at our pace. The drinks are off to the side and can be picked up the customer. I love that idea however, I already witness a homeless person actually take a drink without paying. So thats the only down side to having the drinks available to anyone.

The empanadas here are good. Theres only one that i have fallen inlove with. The reggaeton is the name of it. It has rice and peas inside and pulled pork. It sounds crazy but it WORKS. They put a bunch of flavor into this empanada. Its not dry but very juicy. I highly recommend it. I did get the Toro one and it came with oxtail and sweet plantains. I dont recommend that one. The plantains were NOT sweet and i did not enjoy the flavor on the oxtail. The beef empanadas are good. I've had both fried and baked. Baked is delish.

I took a gambled and ordered the fried pork with tostones. It was horrible but wasnt the best. It could of been crisper but then the meat would of been burned. The tostones were perfect!!! Thin, crispy. I did not enjoy the sauces i ordered. The garlic is really good but i didnt like the pink or green sauce.

I tried the homemade lemonades here. They need to be more consistent. I bought two and one was soooo sour. I tried the next and it was sweet and not sour. So i wouldnt personally try it again because its almost $5 and still needs to be adjusted. I got the cherry lemonade and i couldnt taste the cherry in it at all. Just sour lemon.

Nothing in here is cheap. Not even the empanadas.

Overall, i will continue to come here and order empanadas. I def recommend ordering through the app because you wont have to stand in here and wait. The empanadas do NOT come out quickly as they are fried on demand...which is a plus.",4
45,Empanada Mama East Village (14th St),"239 1st Ave., New York, NY 10003, USA",4.2,K R,"This location is a true gem of east village. Their empanadas are always full of flavor and perfectly cooked.

51,Luthun,"432 E 13th St, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.7,Greg Lellouche,"A truly exceptional dining experience.   If you don't like spice in your food, do not go there.  If you don't like any heat in your food, do not go there.  However, if you like those things,  the tasting menu at Luthun is a rare example of zero-misses in the world of more creative and inventive cuisine.  It's usually a corollary of creativity and culinary ""research"" to end up with dishes that are creative but not as tasty as they should be.   There are none of those here.  From the first bite to the incredible dessert, everything is bursting with flavors, colors, creativity.

The counter experience is reminiscent of early Momofuku Ko with a real engagement of the diner with the cuisine, conversations with the chef and cooks about the produce or techniques.  So friendly, so satisfying to anyone who cares about food.

A lovely experience all around.",5

Every dish lacked flavor, depth and any resemblance of creativity. In fact, every dish tasted the SAME. It was quite unbelievable and I kept hoping the dish was a miss and the next would be better, but that never happened.

The staff was friendly but did not seem at all educated on the ingredients, including wine list. Really odd for a fine dining restaurant.

Overall very bizarre that anyone found this experience worth the price.",1
54,Luthun,"432 E 13th St, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.7,Cindy Yang,"Service: very friendly.

Menu: they change every 2 weeks. It's around 9 course

Highlights:
The fusion of Italian and Mexican cuisine. very unique tastes. Seafood and cheese based dishes are outstanding.

Can do better:
1Ô∏è‚É£wagyu beef is not cooked to perfection. The bottom part is really chewy
2Ô∏è‚É£course timing: I sat at the counter and at the beginning, food are served too fast. Dining tables open up for seating later in the night which caused relatively long waiting time for main courses to be ready for the counter. This is definitely Michelin standard but I think this place may win a Michelin star ‚≠êsoon if they improve a bit.

I get it we all have bad days but that was uncalled for.  He‚Äôs lucky I paid before he had that attitude with me because I would‚Äôve just walked away without the food.

He always has that dog face whenever I ask him for more sauce on the side as if I‚Äôm saying something wrong to him. I like the younger guy with hair, he‚Äôs very nice and pleases the customer and I never had an issue with him. I don‚Äôt recommend buying from there when the bald older guy is around.",2

I was going to tip a $1 and pay with cash ($9+1)but he raised the price on me randomly. I didn‚Äôt fight it cause I was going to pay $10 anyway, but its wrong to be charged $9 one day and $10 the next. Prices on display still show $9 too. I paid cash on both days.",2

They are really quick and friendly. This is one of my favorite place in Manhattan.,5

Calamari was best I have had in a while! Steak was delicious! Wish steak dish had a little something extra than just lettuce, maybe some veggies. Pasta was good, but needed something else for the price. Dessert was delicious as well. The garden sitting area was very beautiful!

4 stars, because menu needs a redoing, electronic ipads and not easy to navigate, and I think they need to go to a QRcode system.",4

The second you walk in, you are greater by the hostess, the atmosphere is a delight, this is such a beautiful restaurant. The minute you sit you are given water and bread. This place was very busy and still I received amazing service, not once did I have to look for my waiter, and when my waiter wasn't around, there was another gentleman who asked if I were okay.

I was in the mood for salad and pizza, and let me tell you, it was some of the best food I've eaten in NYC in some time. The pizza was made to perfection. I love the fact that the first thing you see when you walk in the place is the pizza oven, so you immediately know they are serious about pizza. The quality of the ingredients were top notch. The salad with shaved Parmesan was amazing. And then the ice cream was the perfect ending to bless the palette.... I also loved that the waiter spoke Italian and the other gentleman spoke Spanish as I am half Italian and half Spanish.

This was a great experience. I am an Executive Chef and I can say that this place is a perfect example of how a restaurant should be run, they have the perfect people working there.

I will be coming back and I will make sure to spread the word amongst my peers.",5

Disappointing, but fair enough. It happens.

However, I've been going back and forth with the restaurant for weeks afterwards trying to be refunded, and have not been successful. I shouldn't have to spend a material amount of my time trying to rectify the restaurant's mistake. No way to do business.",1

A bit difficult to know the name of the restaurant from looking at it, but there's Japanese lanterns hanging all along the awning.

- Nabeyaki Udon is good - comes with 2 shrimp tempura, snow peas, shitake mushroom, fish cakes, and chicken chunks in a hot ceramic pot.  The chicken was a bit dry but everything else was good.
- Oyako don - chicken was a bit dry, and not enough egg
- They have complimentary green tea if you ask for it.

Not sure if it's always the same kind of music, but it seemed like old fashioned Japanese music imitating American music over the radio.  Not a huge fan, but it was interesting and different.",4

The vibe of the restaurant was lovely; very warm and inviting. Our server was very nice but really wasn‚Äôt very present after our initial meeting and ordering of our entrees.

I had the buckwheat pizzocheri which I thought was incredible and one of the most delicious things I‚Äôve had in a while. Our friend has the beef & ricotta meatballs which were also very good. My husband ordered the brisket which is not normally on the menu and was flavorful but also very fatty/chewy to the point that he sent it back. The manager who we notified of the dish was very kind, professional, and honest. She recommend he get a different dish and they comped the initial order.

The salad and fried vegetables were really good, but I found the fish I ate very oily and didn't like it. But since there are few places like this, I give this Greek place a good score.

I was greeted immediately and was seated. The table was quite clean and the restaurant was pretty much empty. I was served pretty good bread, I did like that there was a slight charcoal aftertaste.

I ordered a ginger ale and grilled calamari. The calamari was plated well, and it built the anticipation for me to indulge. I was happy with the first bite. I haven‚Äôt had grilled calamari in a while, and this was a good portion and it was tasty/filling.

I was also given dessert which resembled a cheesecake, and it was pretty decent.

In all, I wouldn‚Äôt mind coming back and trying more of the menu, especially the seafood. The one thing I  would say is that I was charged $20.95 for Calamari and I was there after 4 pm (their Happy Hour is from 4 pm-6 pm).

The food was great (I just wish the injera was a little more fermented!!).  We also had our favorite Sheba Tej (honey wine). Make sure to make a reservation in advance if visiting on a weekend.,4
126,Balade,"208 1st Ave., New York, NY 10009, USA",4.4,Andrei Jaume Willenska,"Hands down, one of the best Lebanese restaurants in all of New York. You should dress up a bit since it is more of an upscale place, and they won't allow shorts or anything like that. I think you also need a reservation, or you will wait a long time, and I mean a LONG time. But if you manage to get a table, you will enjoy a feast. The Supreme Platter is absolutely amazing, and it feeds two people very comfortably.  My girlfriend and I had leftovers. They bring juicy lamb, kebabs, steaks, some veggies, pita bread. Definitely try it out!",5
127,Balade,"208 1st Ave., New York, NY 10009, USA",4.4,Mohammed Alsalman,"I had the absolute pleasure opportunity of visiting Balade for a nice ftoor meet up I had with one of my friends.

When we first arrived to the restaurant the place was packed and full, you could really tell that they‚Äôre known for their fine quality levantine food. I had originally booked our table for 7:45, but unfortunately was not seated till about 8:30 which was pretty disappointing but it appeared that on that night they had open tables, hence the overbooking.

When we first stepped in we were greeted with the warmest hospitality by the waiters and were met with the fine geacw scent of freshly baked pita bread.

We glimpsed quickly through the menu, full of the finest Lebanese meals and finally decided on getting Hummus Bal lahma, balade mixed grill, beef shawarma, and rose water.

I will have to say though their hummus bal lahma was very soft as hummus should always be when made finely, so it really settled well on our tongues.  The mixed grill kebab was as fine as it got in terms of levantine kabab, their chicken shish tawoq especially had the most tender and mouthing watering texture that absolutely made your heart meltThe beef shawarma was served with rice and a nice Mediterranean salad; their rice was very soft and warming with the vermicelli cooked into it. Me personally, I‚Äôve never been the biggest fan of beef shawarma but the experience I had at Balade completely altered my perspective, I definitely look forward to coming back and having their shawarma again.

Finally the rose water that really complimented the whole meal, something sweet and light that balances out the savory meats we had.

I do also want to emphasize on how soft and warm their pita was, hats off to the chef all the way.

Our waiter Jawad, if I‚Äôm not mistaken, was very welcoming and enthusiastic made us feel right at home and even helped us chose out their tastiest meals.

I‚Äôve been to trying to find a table at Balade for so long now and I can‚Äôt emphasize on how it was definitely worth all the wait. I‚Äôm coming back again and again for sure!",5

It‚Äôs got a nice casual atmosphere, friendly servers, and large portions of great food. I started with the crispy spring rolls which were decent but it was the pho that really did it for me. These are some large bowls so you‚Äôre definitely getting value here. But they don‚Äôt sacrifice quality - the broth was super flavorful with perfectly cooked noodles and lots of tender meat. I usually get the pho my first time at a Vietnamese place but really want to come back to try their banh xeo which is pretty rare to find in NYC.",5

The beef brisket were more lean than any fat which I really love. I also love that they paid attention to detail by also adding 7 slices of fresh jalape√±o to our side dish of bean sprouts and Vietnamese mint that came with our pho. The meal was very filling and delicious. I can‚Äôt wait to come back again, especially for the fried calamari.",5

The last two reviews are dead right and there‚Äôs nothing good about this place AND food. Age old meat which was chewy, burnt cauliflower, dirty restroom with no soap. I ended up not eating my meal and complained to the waiter.

Abdul was apologetic and offered another meal, but I wasn‚Äôt crazy to try anything else their. NYC Health Department should investigate them!",1
151,Frangos Peri Peri,"182 Avenue B, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.3,Toby Lol,"I've tried this place three times...in hopes that maybe it's just my palette that's different... all three times their food was just not edible to me due to overseasoning of some sort (either it was too sour or too salty or too spicy)

The service attitude is okay.
(I don't want to ruin a business by giving them one star because I know it's difficult to have a family owned business... but also, damn.)

The atmosphere is a bit off as well... there is a strong trash odor immediately before you enter the establishment, and then it becomes faint and lingering once you're inside. Another observation I made was that the soda machine was dripping as well, which required a cup to sit underneath the spout to catch it, but that's neither here nor there, because I'm sure soda machines, or rather machines in general-tend to malfunction every so often.

To my prior experience, the food takes about an average of 20+ minutes for a platter type dish. I waited about 10 minutes for my kebab this time, which was a reasonable wait time.

The food: honestly bad. I have never gone more than 5 bites. I thought maybe it's because I have a particular palette, but the food here tends to be too sour or too salty, or overseasoned in some way, and the quality of the meat is questionable as well. In particular, I ordered the chicken kebab with garlic and herb flavoring today and received this mushy, spongy chicken kebab that was too sour and the meat was just honestly very questionable. I have attached the pictures of it as well.

Please just do yourself a favor and pick a different spot.

Edit* changed to 3 stars because owner replied, I didn't call or anything but I am editing based off their response, which most likely I did receive the vegan version as they said, which was just an honest mistake on their part.",3

Me and my friend waited around 25 minutes for our food to be served and it was definitely not worth the wait, the food portions are very small and I felt scammed to pay $20. I was also looking forward to try their sauces but the caps were so dirty I didn‚Äôt want to take any risks. I‚Äôd recommend you to save your money and go somewhere else.",1

They have a very solid flavor profile when it comes seasoning the meat. Although they did leave a lot of fat on the meat, that could have been cooked off or trimmed before cooking. Flavor was solid. I always enjoy a homemade tortilla over one that store bought. I will give them credit for that. There are better taco options in New York and lots for a better price. I do understand that rent must be paid, and workers need to be paid a fair wage as well. With that being said, if the tacos weren‚Äôt $4.50 + Tax + 4% Card Fee....

I tried their wings, mac n cheese, buffalo fried chicken burger, and their meat burger. I also tried their garlic fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings. Honestly all of them were really good but the man n cheese with the meat was not so much because the neat had a weird distinct flavor.

Also, you should definitely try the sweet chili sauce with the fries and rings! Again, their portions are really big and it‚Äôs a great place for a nice filling lunch!

This simple American eatery serves grass-fed meat & veggie burgers, plus salads & chicken wings. The burgers are packed with flavor, quality, and everything is fresh. I really enjoyed the halal double burger. The customer service was exceptional. This is by far one of the best burger spots I have ever been to.

The food was pretty decent the duck was crispy and flavorful. They're Tom yon soup with chicken was very delightful especially on a chilly day.,4

192,Thursday Kitchen,"424 E 9th St, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.6,Ji Lin Zhu,"A cozy spot in East Village, Thursday Kitchen differentiates itself from the many Korean restaurants in NY by serving Korean-style tapas and juice box drinks in a casual environment. It‚Äôs a fun spot to share good food and try a variety of flavors.

All the tapas we tried were great. My two favorites were the edamame dumplings with a delicious creamy filling and the lucky noodles with good bounce and a kick of spice. The dishes all leaned acidic though, and some could do without the squeeze of yuzu/citrus.

The service and atmosphere were both solid. The space is a bit crammed though and there is a scent of truffle that fills the restaurant. It smelled good but perhaps they need a bit more ventilation.

It's relatively easy to walk into and overall a good pick if you're looking for something more unique than BCD Tofu and more casual than the contemporary Korean spots in the area.",4
193,Thursday Kitchen,"424 E 9th St, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.6,Noel,"This place was not bad. I wish the menu had more straightforward descriptions about its items, for example the gnocchi in spicy and sour sauce was essentially a gnocchi tteokbokki. It has an innovative spin on Korean flavors and ingredients, however I found the execution not the best. Tuna tartar had dill in it but it was not listed as an ingredient on the menu.",3

We visit NYC like once a year and while we‚Äôve had great pizza, there haven‚Äôt been any to write home about‚Ä¶ until Joe & Pat‚Äôs!!! We unfortunately made the decision of going to E Zoo this year, and after not being let in on the last day, we were like let‚Äôs just go get some pizza. We recently moved to Pittsburgh which by the way has absolutely zero thin crust pizza. They like to label their pizzas as thin crust, but they‚Äôre actually pan lol so at this point I‚Äôve been craving TRUE THIN CRUST, like paper thin crust pizza and let me tell you- Joe & Pat‚Äôs is JUST that! Hands down on my top 3 best pizzas I‚Äôve ever had. Perfect consistency of sauce to cheese; I also never eat pizza crust and I did not leave any behind on this one. Perfectly crispy and thin pizza with so much flavor. We also got their meatballs which were delicious. Cute and cozy atmosphere and friendly staff. Can‚Äôt wait to come back!!!",5

Whoever designed this space is damn good at their job, the interior is spacious yet cozy with a good homey feel. Great environment. Staff were awesome, everyone around us was dressed fabulously and having dramatically intellectual conversations. I got their Sabich sandwich, which was a new food for me, and now a new favorite. My father got the chicken kebab, as I don't eat chicken I can't confirm but he said it was excellent and he was a big fan of their fries and spicy ketchup. We had a great time here, highly recommend.",5

We ordered a Moroccan breakfast with scrambled eggs, hummus, two different salads, and pita. We also ordered a side of fries.

The scrambled eggs were incredibly fluffy and tasty and some of the best scrambled eggs I‚Äôve had. Everything on the plate was amazing and was even better when enjoyed together.

The fries were beautifully crispy and salted perfectly.

Everything we tried at Cafe Mogador was amazing. I can‚Äôt wait to come back and try out the rest of their menu items.",5

I was in Hanoi last April. I‚Äôve loved pho since the first time I tried it years ago. So, when my two Vietnamese friends said to try Hanoi House, I couldn‚Äôt wait. I was visiting NYC. I brought my parents for their Christmas gift from me. They had never tried pho before.

We had the spring rolls, papaya salad, and each a bowl of the clsssicbpho. My parents both had the thin filet beef and brisket. I had the filet and bone marrow. Wow, this food was amazing

The papaya salad was so light and fresh. It had the perfect amount of herbs, Thai basil etc and just the right amount of fish sauce, pretty certain that‚Äôs what it was. The spring rolls were delightful, crispy and tasty. My parents coding get enough. But, the star of the show was the pho

Rich and flavorful bone broth. The thin filet slices cooked perfectly in the broth as i stirred it in. I tasted the bone marrow before I scraped it into the broth. Wow. It was so flavorful.

If you love pho, you‚Äôll love Hanoi House.",5
206,Hanoi House,"119 St Marks Pl, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.6,Fabrice Dupuy (KillerFCD),"Love the food, customer service, & overall experience as a whole.

207,Hanoi House,"119 St Marks Pl, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.6,Kaylie Ng,"I‚Äôve been wanting to check out this place for a while. I went on a Friday to get an early dinner, but it was already busy around. Since I went alone, so it wasn‚Äôt too hard for me to get seated, but I could only get the bar table. The atmosphere was quite pleasant, with a cozy and inviting decor.

For my main, I got the two-meat classic beef pho, choosing the rare filet & brisket. I highly recommend the filet. It was very tender and almost gave a ‚Äúmelt-in-your-mouth‚Äù texture. Unfortunately, the brisket was quite tough and chewy, and I ended up not finishing it.

At $18, the price for the pho was pretty good for Manhattan. However, the portion size was a bit on the smaller side compared to other pho spots I've visited.

Overall, it was a good experience. I‚Äôd return in the future, but I'll likely try something other than the brisket next time.",5
208,Hanoi House,"119 St Marks Pl, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.6,Kevin A,"We had the Pho Dac Biet. Bone marrow was interesting, oily and salty. The pho itself was really good, the broth was unique with many flavors although a tad bit salty. The spring rolls were great and flavorful, a tad too oily for me though.",4
209,Evil Katsu,"435 E 9th St, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.6,Cherri Chan,"The best part was the crust! The crust from the fried cauliflower or the Katsu are crispy and delicious! The bread was fluffy and fragrant!

However, the egg salad was too dense for me. Garlic rice was not garlicky and had no flavor.

Katsu was juicy, if it could be fried under 30-45 seconds, it would have been perfect! Fried cauliflower was a little hard in the center.",3
210,Evil Katsu,"435 E 9th St, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.6,ReedH,"I decided to try this place last night as I was in the mood for a good Katsu. Sadly this was not it. The katsu here isn‚Äôt authentic at all and the pork turned at to be dry with the crust falling off. As for the curry, I wish they‚Äôd offered different spice levels - it was fairly mild and I prefer mine with more kick.",2
211,Evil Katsu,"435 E 9th St, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.6,Christi Balaki,"The chicken katsu curry (5/5) was incredible - moist, piping hot, and intensely flavorful. But it is pricey. The pork katsu (3/5) was not very good - it was dry but still tasty. The curry is really good as well.",5
212,Evil Katsu,"435 E 9th St, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.6,Vit Kanesh,The food was mouthwatering. The curry was as spicy as I wanted it. I grabbed lunch and walked to the park and enjoyed my day. 10/10 would come back.,5

Both are aesthetically pleasing; however, that‚Äôs where it ends; the egg salad had no taste whatsoever, no kick, no pizzazz,nothing. As for the curry Bowl, the bites had a nice crisp texture on the outside but I found them overall to be salty, the curry had a kick to it, but again that's where it ends. Based on these factors I find the food to be overpriced and overrated. Felt like I wasted my time & money.",2

It was nice of the staff to do so since it was a little on the chilly side for outdoor dining. I don't remember what my friend ordered but I got the mixed grill. We also had the sampler as an appetizer that came with the hummus, lebneh and I forgot the 3rd item. It was delicious and fresh but the plates were  small for the high price. The highlight of the place is probably the hookah vibe which isn't for all. I actually came for the Mediterranean food and Egyptian vibes. The food was good but not worth what I paid for it.",4

You need to book a month in advance but if you get really lucky you‚Äôll get a random notification something has opened up, the space is intimate. Elevated but also casual. Chef is so sweet and just amazing. The selection was definitely something you have not had at other omakase spots. They do seasonal menus which is great if you go back more than once. The waiter was very attentive and made sure you knew exactly what you were eating or drinking while also giving you the background of it as well. Speakeasy is very small, it‚Äôs for after dinner only. Sits about 6 people. They have a self playing piano. Would definitely go back ! Thank you Mr Moto for such a great experience",5

You are told to solve a riddle in order to gain the passcode for entry, which you need to type in to enter. Once you‚Äôre through the door, you are in a cozy omakase environment, with very limited seating. It makes for a very intimate night and experience. Throughout the meal, you‚Äôre served excellent cuts of fish and steak, which are explained by the chef and waiters. You can opt for a sake or wine pairing, and I recommend the sake. I do wish the dessert was more thought out, but overall the meal was great. I really enjoyed this experience and dinner, if you can snag a reservation, I highly recommend!",4

While the head chef is very kind and the service is solid, Mr. Moto has a huge flaw. The course preparation isn't only done by the head chef. Multiple chefs create inconsistencies, this was even worse because the other chef clearly didn't take his job very seriously.

Not only was he less skilled (rice portions were different each time), he also didn't care about the details. He would leave a few grains of rice left on top of the fish or pour too much sauce by accident. The worst was when the nigiri literally fell apart. I watched him realize, place the fish on top, and serve it anyways.

While he didn't serve our party, these details cheapen the experience. The fish quality was still great and the courses were delicious. However, at this price range, that doesn't really earn you bonus points.",3

So that drew me in. And oh my god. I just found my new comfort food. I will walk across the city for their Desi Poutine. I'm hooked.

In addition to the poutine, I tried the Vegan 7 Vegetable Kathi Roll with Curried Carrots, Bell Peppers, Onions, Tomatoes, Green Peas, Broccoli & Cauliflower. Delicious! I'm hooked on this place and I need to find reasons to come to the neighborhood now.",5

The girl at the register with the glasses got my order wrong refused to admit it and chose to argue with me in front of other customers. It was really tacky and embarrassing. It led to me just walking out. I was really excited to try this place because I live around the corner. Food is really expensive so for her to be getting orders wrong. It‚Äôs kind of unfair, especially if she isn‚Äôt willing to take accountability. I had to repeat the drink. I want to her three times. I wonder what happened to compassion?

There was a whole section for vegetarian options which made it so hard to decide on which to try. We did family style and had a bit of it all.

The last time I ate there, a week ago, a couple of Indians from Mumbay were there eating by chance too, for the first time, and they confirmed the quality of the food, I've experimented all the times. Very suggested! Chicken Korma, my best choice (my Karma). Just writing about it make me miss. Very curious to try the new concept restaurant that will open soon 45th St and 3rrd Av, as I learned from rhe kind and smiling staff. It has been 30 years I travel to New York. There's always the possibility to discover new magic places to eat. This is surely one of them! I realized that I didn't take many photos of the dishes (too commited to eat).

And the interior is super comfy.
I can just recommend to try this restaurant out (especially the ravioli).",5
245,Giano,"126 E 7th St, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.7,Sam,My favorite neighborhood Italian spot. Every pasta I had has been fantastic and I love the complimentary bread. Also have a great affordable wine selection. Highly highly recommend for a date night.,5
246,Giano,"126 E 7th St, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.7,Johnny Novo,"After my best friend/roommate/USC basketball superstar got DUMPED, he hadn't stepped outside our apartment for 7 days straight. He normally gets a haircut every 3 days, so after he skipped the 2nd one of the week, I really began to worry.

After a long week of hearing Drake's ""Tried Our Best"" on loop faintly coming from his room, I knew I had to get him outside. I thought dragging him to his favorite restaurant would be the first step in curing his crippling depression and stop our apartment from flooding with tears of what could have been. I also couldn't listen to ""Tried Our Best"" anymore.

I recommended we go to Giano, as I knew he and his ex hadn't been there so it was a safe space and no PTSD would occur: ""What if we go to Giano, Big Bro? We haven't been in forever!"" ... For the first time in a week, I saw his ears perk up a bit and saw some semblance of his soul begin to re-enter his light brown eyes. ""Uhmmmm, yeah. I could do that, Lil Cuzzo."" After dragging his feet like a little kid mad at his mom for 4 blocks, we arrived at the promised land. We walked into the small but cozy Italian interior with no reservation. It was PACKED.

""No reservation?"" the host asked in a thick Northern Italian accent. My voice said ""No res, no worries if we can't get I know it's a big ask"" but my eyes were screaming ""Please god just have a seat for us. We can't take another L this week..."" She heard my eyes loud and clear, and we were seated immediately.
Upon sitting down, I immediately ordered 2 bottles of Chianti which I know gives alcoholic tendencies, but I had to wean this man off the magnum handle of grey goose in any way possible and I wasn't going to let him drink alone and feel like there is not another single soul in the universe that is there for him. Plus red wine is good for you hehehehe :).

He ordered the lasagna, and I of course ordered the tagliatelle alla bolognese because I'm a BEAST!

He obviously didn't touch the bread that was served to start the meal off, as this man is semteem* lbs down from a week ago, but I was cool with that because it was straight HEAT. Few things like some fresh bread and olive oil.

When his lasagna came, he just sat there staring at it like a sick Golden Retriever looking at its bowl of Pedigree Dog Food.

After I was half way through my delicious bolognese, I saw his right paw, fork in hand, put enough pressure to FINALLY cut through his lasagna. He slices a big piece and finally takes a bite.

I detailed earlier about how I saw his soul re-enter his body a bit when I mentioned Giano, but this bite really brought my brotha BACK! It must have been what Jesus felt when he saw his boy Lazarus come back to life after being dead for 4 days. Not saying I'm Jesus but..... tendencies........
He HOUSED that thing. I legit had only seen this man eat the Jayson Tatum Ruffles all week, so him eating this whole piece of lasagna was damn near a miracle. Giano is really like that.

After cleaning his plate, he whips out his phone, furiously types something and says ""I just hit my barber I need to get a mf cut it's been a minute!""

THIS GIANO LASAGNA BROUGHT MY BOY BACK TO LIFE! THANK YOU GIANO! GIANO LASAGNA THE HEARTBREAK CURE!

I went with my friend on a Saturday night and I would definitely recommend reserving your seats in advance because it‚Äôs really popular. We ordered Corn Dumplings(best of the best), oxtail and Wagyu spring roll(such a unique combo), Tartare, Rice with Octopus(my favorite sweet and savory combo) and Scallop(so fresh and flavorful). They have a good range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks as well. The service and atmosphere are absolutely top-tier. It‚Äôs so worth the price. 10 out of 10 recommend!!",5
250,Mokyo,"109 St Marks Pl, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.7,Clare Na,"My most favorite restaurant in the city. The chef is amazing and the staffs are great! I love how the menu changes every season.
The chef is very talented and creative. All the dishes are delicious and assembled beautifully. I love how the chef combines Korean and other regions to present something special. The taste is very original and new.
The pacing of the service is great. There isn‚Äôt much wait time for your next dishes.
My favorite dish is the lobster. All the dishes are excellent but if you have to pick one, I highly recommend the lobster roll.",5
251,Mokyo,"109 St Marks Pl, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.7,Les W,"Food was good, and I enjoyed my experience at Mokyo. The staff was accommodating and service was excellent. The drinks were a highlight and were strong.

Portion sizes are small, appetizer portions, and you might need 3 dishes per person to feel full.

Highlight dishes were the octopus congee dish, which was similar to a risotto texture, the corn dumplings, and the ceviche special.

Lobster roll was a bit dry and overpowered by the truffle, I would probably avoid that if I returned.

Desserts were pretty good too, overall a nice experience.",5
252,Mokyo,"109 St Marks Pl, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.7,Julia Hsia,"For me, keep people who have reservations waiting is a NO for restaurants. We had a reservation but waited 20 mins still.
Food was good, small portion means to order a couple of items to share. Price looks good but going up high fast if you are thinking about getting full.

I would recommend the üçñribs, well seasoned and marinated. Meat was soft.

Second one goes to üçöü•Ñrice with octopus. Rich flavor as you dig into it. The texture was like risotto.

‚ú®Tartare was good too. Kinda a good option.

Corn dumpling was interesting but slightly too fancy since the taste of truffle was strong that covered other tastes. The texture of the filling was like smashed potato, creamy.

Spring roll was the same, kinda good but too fancy with a high price.

Eventually, my best goes to dessert, üç®üåüinjeolmi mousse.. outstanding one! Lots of layers inside, moist and crunchy textures. Love the taste. Highly recommend.",4
253,Mokyo,"109 St Marks Pl, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.7,Jennifer C. Gonzalez-Alcaras,"The food and service was outstanding. If I could have ordered everything on the menu I would have, the carpaccio, tartare, corn dumplings, cockles, rolls, ribs were incredible. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!",5
254,Mama Fina‚Äôs,"167 Avenue A, New York, NY 10009, USA",4.3,Arun Gayam,"I had some of the best pork dishes here. I think about the pork sig sig almost daily. This dish had a nice spice to it and the crispy bits of pork just had amazing texture as I chewed. You have to pair this with the garlic rice! I also enjoyed the Pork Kare Kare, the sauce wasn‚Äôt too sweet and the pork was still crispy. I should also mention the Beef Salpicao which was very tasty. We paired this all with the garlic rice and it was amazing.
The service was also good here and the restaurant is a nice vibe. The end it off, we got our hands on the Halo Halo and it was also a Burt of flavor and textures. I would recommend you try this since it‚Äôs filled with so many toppings like Bean/jelly/ice cream. It‚Äôs a huge portion too!
I would reccomend this for first times who want to try Filipino food!
I have to come back to try the Pork Adobo",5

The dishes were absolutely addictive - the adobo sauce was so flavorful that I could drink it by itself, and the sisig was so crispy and oily, it went great with the rice. The portions are quite big and filling, but both my friend and I were super hungry so we ended up finishing them. We also stayed afterwards.to keep talking and the staff was super understanding!",5

They were not only out of the main veggie entree (tofu sisig), but also ran out of any veggie sides except some beans. They improvised with fried eggs, with some cajoling.

Some of my friends had reported that the dishes came out of order. Servers were generally polite.

To add insult to injury, they charged us for the items they had run out of, and refused to make good on the check.

Atmosphere in the restaurant was pleasant.

Will not be going back though.",1

Many NYC pizzerias will charge $5/6 dollars for a speciality slice and Burrata is no different. However, the slice you get is hearty and dense.

the ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù aka a plain NYC slice is really good. thin blanket of melted mozzarella; floating on a layer of flavorful sauce; all balanced on a relatively thin crisp crust with some chew. honestly the plain slice has what you want in a NYC slice: a balance of seasoned flavors, aromas,  and textures. my slice from a freshly baked pie‚Äîand that made it all all the better. ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù slice, $3.50 + tip

Ambiance: Such a beautiful vibe. It's intimately lit which makes it a great spot for date night. It's also got a great bar with this gorgeous decor over it. The environment really makes you want to sit and grab a drink before dinner.

Food: The food is small plate style. I like this concept because it gives me a chance to try more of the menu. We got most of the veggie ""to share"" plates and 2 of the pasta dishes. Every single item did not disappoint. Each dish was well seasoned and balanced. Some of the combinations sounded different but they worked really well together.

Service: Service was pretty perfect. Everyone checked in the right amount and even gave us great recommendations on what we should order.

Price: It's the typical prices of NYC restaurant but the food and ambiance make it totally worth it.

Anyway, the reviews are real, and now this is another suspiciously long one. Pretty meta.

The food is so good, really. It reminds me of some Indian food from childhood. DO NOT GO HERE, only so there's more food for me. I love how they separate the vegan from the vegetarian options. The okra was really special.",5

We started with brunch drinks, the Pineaperol Spritz (great way to mix up your classic Aperol Spritz) and a Bloody Mary, both $15. We had the Mezze platter ($15), which was actually fairly loaded with dip and would be enough for 3-4 people to share. The quiche that day ($14) was salmon and goat cheese, which was loaded with salmon- as a salmon lover, I thought it was great! The fried chicken biscuit ($20, +$2 to add an egg) was a great choice as well. The chicken breading was crispy and the hot honey hit the spot. Service was friendly and attentive.",4

Idk where they got ""best burger 2016"", I guess those were different times. But what soured me about this place was not the food, or the super long wait times, or even the fact that the steak dish we ordered came was raw and uncooked and we had to send it back (which I feel terrible doing). What soured me was their ""surge pricing"" model.

Call it surge pricing, or price gouging.. the lunch menu lists the burger for $11, while the brunch menu lists it for $19. So I asked ""what's the difference between the burger on the lunch menu versus brunch"", and the server said ""none"". So of course I asked ""any additional sides or anything"" and they responded again ""no they're the same"".

But since they don't offer the lunch burger menu before 5pm, I agreed to get the higher priced brunch burger. But I asked if they could do the Swiss bacon burger instead (which is $13 on the lunch menu), but the server refused and said I'd have to pay the additional fees to upgrade from American cheese to Swiss, and to add bacon. So I was up-charged to $24, for the same burger that will cost $11 less, only 1.5 hours later. Yeah it's a basic mediocre $10 burger (which is close to the price they usually charge), but def not a $24 burger. What a disappointing experience.",2

I had the crying tiger gyoza as an appetizer and the black panther curry for a main. For drinks I have the kitty on fire,amazing firework. She had the Tiger Killer. Simply amazing and delicious! The atmosphere is really beautiful as well!!",5

The mix of Thai and Japanese flavors was unique and flavorful. For the price, this is a good deal. I enjoyed most of the pieces, but what stood out to me were the tunas, oyster, eels, smoked scallop, and wagyu with monkfish liver.

Sake pairings were okay, and dessert was cute but seemed out of place with the quality of the omakase.

Service was nice and tentative. Cocktails were fun and enjoyable too.

I‚Äôve been wanting to go to this place for a long time and finally went for dinner with my friend. We ordered TUNA RICE CRACKER(rec!), STONE GRILLED WAGYU(my favorite!), CRYING TIGER STEAK(mediocre), 11TIGERS TOM YUM RAMEN(the biggest shrimp I‚Äôve ever seen). The service and atmosphere are average. It‚Äôs on the higher end but worth it for the taste!!",4
