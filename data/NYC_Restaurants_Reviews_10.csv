1,Mido‚Äôs,"631-615 6th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.7,Fabiola Zoxie Fontaine,"I recently tried this fantastic Halal food cart in the city! I ordered both the Chicken over Rice and Lamb over Rice platters, which were priced at $9 each. While the flavors were amazing, I felt the portion of meat could have been more generous. They included fries with the meal, but if not eaten immediately, they tend to get soggy. The convenience of accepting credit cards is a plus. The service was quick, and the staff were friendly. I particularly enjoyed their hot sauce, which had a satisfying level of heat. Overall, I recommend this Halal cart for its tasty options and efficient service.",4
2,Mido‚Äôs,"631-615 6th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.7,SH,"Wow there are more chicken than rice!! So great!! And they are super professional, taking orders in orderly. Price and good were so great. No wonder they have no ratings!! Would def go back!",5
3,Mido‚Äôs,"631-615 6th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.7,W aLe,"Delicious food and tasty ü§§
You can‚Äôt beat the price $9 for a whole platter ,
Spicy rice over chicken  is the one to go for",5
4,Mido‚Äôs,"631-615 6th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.7,Shelbi Richardson,"There a lot of chicken and rice/Halal food places throughout New York, but I strongly feel you should give your business to this one. I have gotten a meal from here for about 3 days in a row (just so far) because it‚Äôs so good. Easily my new favorite meal. The men running the cart are very hardworking and kind. They remember our order each time. I couldn‚Äôt even wait to take the photo and started eating it already. We also got a hotdog that we ate before I could get a picture. Their food is amazing, and it‚Äôs because their attitude and work ethic reflects in it. 11/10, please try this place if you‚Äôre in the neighborhood.",5
5,Mido‚Äôs,"631-615 6th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.7,A PG,"I‚Äôm a repeat customer to this cart for a number of reasons. $$ is fair, and food is great. Guys are always greeting me with a smile and ready to take order.",4
6,Rosa Mexicano,"9 E 18th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.2,Bryan Senker,"Our recent visit to Rosa Mexicano in New York City was a delightful experience from start to finish! As a big group, finding a place that accommodates everyone comfortably can be a challenge, but Rosa Mexicano handled it with ease. They had plenty of room for all of us, and the staff was incredibly attentive, enhancing our evening with their prompt and friendly service.The culinary highlight of the night had to be the fajitas. They were absolutely amazing‚Äîperfectly seasoned, sizzling hot, and paired beautifully with sides that complemented the flavors well. Another standout was their fresh guacamole, prepared right at our table. It was fresh, flavorful, and a real treat for our taste buds.Overall, our experience at Rosa Mexicano was fantastic. Whether you‚Äôre dining as a large group or a small one, you can look forward to great food and excellent service in a welcoming environment. Highly recommended for anyone looking to enjoy a wonderful meal in the heart of New York City!",5
7,Rosa Mexicano,"9 E 18th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.2,David Ryan,"The food is always spot on, generous portions, and on the pricing high end. There‚Äôs a great chance you will have a fun experience and be full too. This place is really big and bright, so bring on the guacamole. I enjoyed the chicken quesadillas too.",4
8,Rosa Mexicano,"9 E 18th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.2,Adrian Alonso,"All the food was delicious! The best were the guacamole dip and the birria tacos, so tasty!!! I will go back just for those. But everything was really nicely prepared, the margaritas, the queso dip, the Ceviche,... Also the staff was helpful and friendly. Plus they have outside dining which was perfect for us to have lunch with our dog. Totally recommended!!!",5
9,Rosa Mexicano,"9 E 18th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.2,Andrew E,"Energetic happy tasty place to spend some celebratory moments.  Great food, cocktails  and service.  We loved the blood orange margaritas.  Get a pitcher! Yumbo!",4
10,Rosa Mexicano,"9 E 18th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.2,cassy,"The ambiance was good, and the music was loud, take that as you will. We had to wait a bit for a table but some bar seats opened up, and it was ready sooner than expected.

The margarita was just ok in my opinion, especially considering they claim it is highly rated, not bad though.

The cheese enchiladas were good but the rice wasn't the best. The esquites was really good.",3
11,Thai Villa,"5 E 19th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.7,Maribel Franco,"Me and my sister had a girls date. We love Thai food and research before coming to Thai Villa. The service was truly exceptional. Our cocktails were definitely something different. The food was definitely a 10 star. from the moment we arrived the waiters and bartender were greeting everyone with smiles, and that is a focal point when you enter a restaurant . beautiful decor and they are very attentive to your table once you sit down. We will definitely be back truly one of a kind.",5
12,Thai Villa,"5 E 19th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.7,yuyu („ÇÜ„ÇÜ),"VERY GOOD! Food was delicious, service was FANTASTIC, atmosphere was perfect for a special dinner. I ordered a duck curre and was 10/10 delicious. The appetizer we got (chicken wrapped in some leaves) was also 10/10 delicious. Would definitely dine here again! Wish we lived closer. We went there on a Sunday at 6:30 with a reservation. Looks pretty packed so might want to make a reservation in advance!",5
13,Thai Villa,"5 E 19th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.7,L. Wissanee,"I ordered takeout through DoorDash and it was amazing! As someone who is Thai, it can be challenging to find restaurants that cook authentic Thai food. I brought my family to New York and I want to try Thai restaurants near our hotel. Thai Villa restaurant food was so delicious.",5
14,Thai Villa,"5 E 19th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.7,Pain,"Amazing experience! We made a reservation for a table of four around the holidays in December and we sat on the second floor, overlooking the rest of the restaurant. The ambience is romantic, perfect for a date or even a family setting. Food was really delicious and cheap too, for Manhattan. I would recommend the papaya salad and the Tom Yum soup. The soup was amazing.",5

16,Guac Time Mexican Grill,"599 6th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.2,Arshdeep Singh,"I recently had lunch here with my girlfriend , and it was a fantastic experience. The food was delicious, and the service was quick and friendly. I particularly enjoyed the variety of menu options they offer, and the flavors were on point. The avocado taco box was a personal favorite, and their hot sauces added an extra kick to the meal. It never disappoints when I'm craving Mexican-inspired fast food. I'll definitely be back for more!",5
17,Guac Time Mexican Grill,"599 6th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.2,Shawn C.,The beef seems too firm and lacks flavor - I would have liked it to be more tender and juicy (and tasty) but it wasn‚Äôt. The avocado taco box is a nice vegetarian option. I only came here because the nearest taco bell was closed.,2
18,Guac Time Mexican Grill,"599 6th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.2,·¥ã·¥Ä…™,"The burrito was delicious. It was a Mexican and Indian fusion. The burrito was very flavorful, filling but light at the same time. They gave good portions I highly recommend this place. Also on Uber Eats they have a good deal when you buy one, get one free. The guy was nice and friendly. Good service!",5
19,Guac Time Mexican Grill,"599 6th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.2,Emoni Ellis,Ordered food from here for my break. THEY FORGOT TO PUT THE CHICKEN IN MY BOWL. Went in for some type of compensation. There was no manager and the workers were very rude. One of the workers said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have time for this customer‚Äù to another worker IN MY FACE. Did end up getting a new bowl but will not be coming back to this location. They need to work on their customer service skills!!!,2
20,Guac Time Mexican Grill,"599 6th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.2,Noor Amin,Halal options.  Otherwise very average and won‚Äôt go out of my way to return.  Nowhere to wash hands.  I love hole in the wall restaurants when the food is worth it but this place doesn‚Äôt make the cut.  FYI 4% extra to use credit card,3
21,Hollywood Diner,"574 6th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",3.9,Priyanka Priyanka,"Went here for dinner. The food was okay and it's pricier than some other diners. The service isn't great because we waited a long time for the food and we had to ask another server if they forgot our order. They have a good seating area, both inside and outside. This place isn't bad but it isn't great either!",4
22,Hollywood Diner,"574 6th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",3.9,PhilYouIn,"Small to medium sized diner on the corner, right by the subway. Fairly empty at 1PM, so we were seated right away. Good service. Coffee hot and delicious. Eggs up were okay, as was my wife‚Äôs breakfast sandwich. Our milk and sugar scraps were picked up right away, and our coffee cups refilled just as quickly. Tiny, old bathrooms. But the diner was just what we were looking for on a rainy day after a doctor visit; good service, good food, and a place to relax without being rushed. Plus, the bill was remarkably inexpensive for these days.",4
23,Hollywood Diner,"574 6th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",3.9,Artem Mordashov,"The atmosphere was OK, not too busy during lunch time, waitress didn't pay much attention and didn't check if things are OK or whether I need the check. Also, she rolled eyes for some reason. Like ""hello""(rolling eyes). ""How many of you?""(rolling eyes). ""What can I get you?""(rolling eyes). It got entertaining eventually. The other waiters were more helpful though. Food was normal, tasted well. Prices were good too.",5
24,Hollywood Diner,"574 6th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",3.9,Gianna Ribecca,"Came by after a night out since they are open 24/7 . Food is decent a bit bland, bit high on the price but its a place to go for after a nights out.",4
25,Hollywood Diner,"574 6th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",3.9,Howard Wong,"Had burgers for lunch that were good. Atmosphere was terrible because the doors were open and they had two men slow sipping beers in the outside tables while commenting on every woman who passed by. Also the service was awful.  The waitress did not come by on a regular basis or even once to see how we are doing.  When I asked for a soda refill she stated, I refilled you once and will have to charge you. I never had that experience at this diner before.  Asked for extra napkins and she counted out 2 napkins.  Who does that these days?",3
26,Sagaponack,"4 W 22nd St, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.6,BusyBurdie,Delicious quality food and great prices. Was there around happy hour time. Clean restaurant with cute friendly staff. Enjoyed all dishes ordered. Would come again. Very good beer battered fish and chips!!! Love the tarter sauce so cold and fresh. The chicken bites crispy and tender and seasoned just right. The parmesean fries so pillowy and light.,5
27,Sagaponack,"4 W 22nd St, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.6,Mira Ciganek,"Delicious and unique menu - a mix of Mediterranean and Asian flavors. We tried a bunch of small plates, our favorites were the salmon tartar, oysters and ironically the chicken bites. Plus their lychee cocktail and thai milk tea cake were incredible. Good deal during happy hour, will definitely be coming back!",5
28,Sagaponack,"4 W 22nd St, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.6,Marzouki,"My server Alex from Louisiana gave me the southern hospitality professional polite attentive service that we used to have back in the day. He is very passionate about the food & what the place has to offer! I miss that as restaurants nowadays have thoughtless waiters & servers. I actually got a dozen & a half of oysters ü¶™ coz the various condiments are delight! $2 best quality Wellfleet oystersü¶™ are a bargain & a deal not to be missed. My fried fish fillet Sammy was scrumptious. Dig the vibe, def recommend. Will be back for more happy hour oysters ü¶™ for sure üòã",5
29,Sagaponack,"4 W 22nd St, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.6,Amy Kang,"Sagaponack is a hidden gem in Flatiron district. Beautiful decor and amazing food. Looks like there was a holiday event going on in mezzanine floor. What a great place to get together with friends and family!
We started out with bunch of oysters,  fluke tartare and gambas al ajillo. Presentation, texture and taste of fluke tartare was sensational!  Oysters were so fresh and loved all different toppings.
For main course, surf and turf was the big winner! Dry aged ribeye and lobster were packed with flavor and big enough portion to share for the table. Thai milk tea cake was so good. I don‚Äôt like sweets but ended up finishing the entire cake! We had an unforgettable holiday gathering at Sagaponack and can‚Äôt wait to come back to try different food.",5
30,Sagaponack,"4 W 22nd St, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.6,Valerie Piro,"Love this place! I‚Äôve been here for lunch and dinner a few times over the past year. I‚Äôm such a fan of their roasted oysters (and the cavatelli, and scallops). Oh, and the earl grey cr√®me br√ªl√©e is a delight, as is the lychee cocktail. Staff are super friendly.",5
31,Pasta Eater,"9 E 17th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.3,Swirl Through The World,Such a lovely dining experience. Upon entering you‚Äôre instantly transported to Europe. The vibes and the decor are wonderful. Everyone we interacted with was so friendly and welcoming. The flavors and portion sizes were perfection! We were there celebrating a birthday and they truly went above and beyond. From the amazing staff to the delectable dishes to the superb ambiance this place is a true gem and we will definitely be back.,5
32,Pasta Eater,"9 E 17th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.3,Javier Kohen,"I noticed this place thanks to the person making pasta that is visible from the street and I decided to check it out. It felt like discovering an underdog. The waiter was extremely attentive and caring. The food was good, but not all was great. I loved the mafaldini, but was not impressed by the four cheese gnocchi (not cheesy), and the salad. They were fine, but I wished I were eating something else. The cheesecake was good!",4
33,Pasta Eater,"9 E 17th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.3,Èô≥Â•ïÂ©∑,"Great vibe of a restaurant. It‚Äôs crowded so it‚Äôs better to make a reservation before coming here. The food itself was ok, I like the appetizer better than the pasta. Good for the first try but the food taste doesn‚Äôt give me strong impression.",4
34,Pasta Eater,"9 E 17th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.3,Nisha Mohan,Food was good albeit a tad salty. Very flavorful. We are vegetarian so the options were somewhat limited. The seating is very close together and we had to stand up on a couple of occasions to let the people seated in more interior tables in and out. The pasta that they cook in the parmesan wheel looked interesting until we saw the meat(ham/bacon) already in the wheel as it was taken to the table - couldn't risk the chance of  cross-contamination after that. But overall a very positive fun experience.,4
35,Pasta Eater,"9 E 17th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.3,Rupa Ved,"Came in for a nice solo dinner after a book signing. Really enjoyed my cozy spot at the bar overlooking the fresh pasta prep area.

Menu included lots of vegetarian items and a variety of flavors. I enjoyed the spinach ravioli, which had a lovely crispy breadcrumb balance against the rich sauce.

The service was very warm and inviting and the restaurant was lively and cozy. I was lucky enough to enjoy a complimentary cannoli with my Nutella tiramisu:)

Would gladly return and try the other vegetarian items on the menu, as well as the cheesecake!",4
36,Tarallucci e Vino Union Square,"15 E 18th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.4,Nehal Ahmed,"We reserved a team lunch here for group of 6. Our table was ready upon arrival. The restaurant has a nice European rustic vibe, with a bar area in front, and outdoor seating as well, weather permitted.

It‚Äôs a full on Italian lunch menu, if you are not familiar with Italian dishes, you would spend a lot of time in Google lol! The lunch menu is also different than dinner menu.

We got the burrata for appetizer. Amazing flatbread with tomato sauce and outrageous burrata cheese. I made sure no cheese was wasted. All of us got variety of dishes from pasta, gnocchi to panini. They all loved and spoke highly of their food. I got the Salmon that was seared so beautifully. The skin was crisp, but a very soft tasty layer underneath. The vegetables on the dish were also cooked so well. The special blueberry non alcoholic drink was solid as well.

Overall e had a fantastic team lunch. Service was incredible. We were in and out within an hour.",5
37,Tarallucci e Vino Union Square,"15 E 18th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.4,Isabelle Ji,"Excellent food when I came here for a private event. This place has got its bread and olive oil RIGHT, with the perfect saltiness and chewiness on the bread. The arugula and walnut salad was my fav dish, it was light, nutty and the dressing was done perfectly. Salmon was also a hit with the crispy and well seasoned skin (eat it w the skin), and got chicken, pasta, potatoes, and asparagus as well all of which were very good if you add a tad bit more salt to it. Berry salad for dessert with the fresh mint was a nice final cleanser.

Edit: Came here again for a small group lunch and the table average rating is probably 3.5. I liked my octopus, but others found their pasta completely bland!",4
38,Tarallucci e Vino Union Square,"15 E 18th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.4,Lucas Rane,"This has quickly become my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood. Reasonably priced and the staff couldn‚Äôt be nicer. I love how they always have new and exciting specials. The tiramisu is a must for dessert. Oh, also this place is one of those Italian places where if you don‚Äôt like the type of pasta or something, they will change it up for you, or remove ingredients etc. they even made me a mocktail! And a lively atmosphere that manages to up my spirits even after a hard day at work. Cool for drinks and snacks, or lunch and dinner. I have yet to try their breakfast but I heard that‚Äôs good too!!",5
39,Tarallucci e Vino Union Square,"15 E 18th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.4,Adam Wilczewski,"This restaurant's food may satisfy your cravings, but beware of the sticky situation beneath the tables with chewing gums, making cleanliness a priority. It's best to steer clear if you prefer a dining experience without unwanted trouser adornments.",2
40,Tarallucci e Vino Union Square,"15 E 18th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.4,Harrison R,"Very good food and service ! Highly recommend the flatbread as well as the orecchiette. The espresso martini was good, too",5
41,Slate NY,"54 W 21st St, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.1,Matthew Sansone,"We went on a (rainy) Tuesday night so consider this is not indicative of them at their busiest.
There are 2 private bar areas right off the lobby with private doors available. If it wasn't for the lobby floor being slippery from the noreaster, there is a slide going from the lobby to the basement. There is a private area in the basement as well.  There are distinct areas for sitting, games, an arcade and the bar. The 1 server came to us very quickly and our food came out quick. Innovative sauces for the chicken strips with more of an unannounced salad than picked veggie garnish, the fry basket was GIGANTIC and perfectly golden brown. The standout was the (perfectly cooked medium) sliders on GARLIC KNOTS!  Some may not consider this a restaurant but I would go back for the food next time I am in the city.",5
42,Slate NY,"54 W 21st St, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.1,Andrea Munoz,"Super cool, vibrant & different lounge/club with a slide to express yourself down into the fun (I found this extremely dope). On the main floor there is a bar and the club, down is the game level with massive space to entertain yourself with the arcade games, mini bowling section, jenga or lounging plus this is a great place to watch sports or events. I went on a Saturday night and of course the place was packed with good music and good vibes, I enjoyed myself with my husband while there yet in my opinion I think we would have had more fun & enjoy better all the games if we came with our own crew, definitely this is the spot to come with a group of friends.",5
43,Slate NY,"54 W 21st St, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.1,Kristy Rix,"This place is really funky, it's a good find by my husband who booked us some tickets for the superbowl.

Good food, drinks and atmosphere. Really busy but to be expected on the occasion!

I loved the different levels, slide, game rooms - was a really good experience.",5
44,Slate NY,"54 W 21st St, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.1,Renee Akselrud,"Super fun spot! I came here to celebrate Halloween with friends and had a great time. There‚Äôs 2 floors, each had their own DJ/ bars. If you don‚Äôt feel like taking the stairs, you could use the slide to get down to the lower level where they had a bunch of games to play. Really nice place to party, the only thing I didn‚Äôt like was security being ‚Äúhands on‚Äù and physically moving people out of the way while trying to get through crowd. Overall, we had a good time and I would go back to see how it is when it‚Äôs not a holiday event.",5
45,Slate NY,"54 W 21st St, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.1,Dani Ser,"Awesome place to be a big kid without kids around. Play giant Uno's, pool, connect 4, jinga or just chill, have a drink get some finger foods and just chill.",4
46,Dos Toros Taqueria,"668 6th Ave #5148, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.2,Downtown Playboy,"Dos Toros is a triple threat: authentic Mexican food, excellent service, and a relaxed dining ambiance. The boss is constantly surveying customer satisfaction, and this ‚Äútest kitchen‚Äù gets a 10 out of 10. The food is tasty, compared to similar options like Chipotle, except this place has an authentic taste. And the location is always clean, and the staff is kind and welcoming.",5
47,Dos Toros Taqueria,"668 6th Ave #5148, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.2,Francisco Olivo,"Clean place and its different comparing to chipotle and qdoba and other competitions. I like that. They have a better cheese and when making the burrito etc is made differently as well. The only thing i was recommended to eat was anything but the red rice which looked weird. Maybe to taste it but not for a second time thing. But all in all a friendly staff, neat place, and great food.",4
48,Dos Toros Taqueria,"668 6th Ave #5148, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.2,Sami Kaba,"I cannot emphasize enough how no one from the Dos Toros marketing team has considered addressing the issue of the paper used to wrap their tacos. It's baffling that despite the numerous complaints, no one seems to be concerned about this matter. I, for one, cannot enjoy tacos when they come glued to a paper. I suggest conducting research to find the proper way to wrap your tacos for deliveries. It's frustrating to see this oversight persist.",1
49,Dos Toros Taqueria,"668 6th Ave #5148, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.2,Nehal Ahmed,"Went back to Flatiron Dos Toros to give it another try, but same result. $14 bowl barely makes it half way. Half spoon of rice, half spoon chicken, literally seems like they are giving away food from their own bowl. Walked out of there still hungry.

I do like the food they make, it's tasty and good quality, but the service and people at the counter are not worth the trip.",3
50,Dos Toros Taqueria,"668 6th Ave #5148, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.2,Lll Nono,"Very clean spot to eat healthy food. Staffs are friendly. Had sweet potato bowl, tastes amazing.
Definitely will come back.",5
51,Periyali,"35 W 20th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.5,Marie Assante,"There's a reason this restaurant has been in business for 37 years, it's consistently great.  The restaurant recently underwent a massive renovation and it feels light, bright and airy.   The service was standout, warm and inviting and the dishes were all delightful.  My friend and I started with the mushrooms and beets and then went onto indulge in the Branzino for two which was massive and served with a large portion of broccolini.  The fish was flavorful and perfectly cooked.  Can't wait for an excuse to go back to try their price fixe menu, which looked like a steal at $49.  Highly recommend!",5
52,Periyali,"35 W 20th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.5,Jess,"Had items off the prix fixie menu $49.
The charcoal grilled octopus was exquisite and cooked just right! It was the best I‚Äôve had in a while.
The garlic sauce from the patzaria skordalia paired well will the octopus.
The bass, however simple it looks, tasted great! A great light dinner at 10pm and close to their closing time on a Friday.

The service was great! Even when they received us an hour plus before closing time. The night was busy but they made sure to get our orders in and out within reasonable time.",5
53,Periyali,"35 W 20th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.5,Tripp Holt,"Food was above average, atmosphere and service were phenomenal.

We had a large group and sampled many items on the menu, family style. The lamb shank was the best, the rabbit was the worst. All of the appetizers were fun.",5
54,Periyali,"35 W 20th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.5,Nicole Louie,Delicious food and incredibly friendly staff. I went to celebrate getting married and the thoughtfulness from the host and waiters was 100% amazing. It was such a pleasant experience,5

56,Limelight ‚Ñ¢ Original Famous Coal Fired Brick Oven Pizzeria NYC,"656 6th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.1,Kevin Drost,"The first time I saw this place it looked so cool outside. I saw it was a brick oven pizzeria and I had to go in and try it. Once inside it‚Äôs a bit smaller than it seems and a little underwhelming. I tried their Original Margarita and their famous clam pie. The clam pie was interesting it has clams, fresh garlic, olive oil, and Parmesan cheese. If you worried about the clams don‚Äôt they don‚Äôt overpower the pizza the garlic overpowers it more. It was a pretty good pie. I would most definitely get it again and suggest it. Their margarita pizza was ok I was expecting fresh bail on it but I saw none. Their famous sauce had a different taste than their regular pizza sauce I‚Äôd say more of a subtle taste nothing really standing out I‚Äôve most definitely have had better pies than that, but apparently Frank Sinatra made famous.  I also had their garlic bread and it was a lot of garlic an overwhelming garlic flavor but I love that. I would say their pizza is most definitely some good pies 4 out of 5 but I gave a less star because of service and a dirty water glass was served at our table that we had to get replaced. Honestly I was expecting more but overall it‚Äôs most definitely better pizza than most other pizza places around.",3
57,Limelight ‚Ñ¢ Original Famous Coal Fired Brick Oven Pizzeria NYC,"656 6th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.1,Dan Belenkov,"Ordered a pizza with extra toppings totalling $8. Then they delivered the pizza with none of those toppings. Would not refund my $8. I was perfectly happy with paying for the pizza I got, but they swiped $8 from me for toppings they didn't add. And that's a problem. A pizza pie @ grimaldi's is ~$30. They lost the opportunity for my business over $8. And NYC is a very competitive pizza market. Plenty of other options. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Moral - don't steal.",1
58,Limelight ‚Ñ¢ Original Famous Coal Fired Brick Oven Pizzeria NYC,"656 6th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.1,Marc Mc,"Hands down the most flavorful pizza in NYC, the crisp is perfect and the ovens they use really add a nice finish to the slice. The ingredients they use are bursting with flavor and are obviously fresh and really add to the pizza. The prices are really reasonable for the size of the pie, and the bottles of wine are really reasonably priced too, always nice to have an Italian red with your food. The service is a bit lacking it seems they struggle with some of the basics, like water or napkins, but the manager chips in and makes up for the wait staff.",5

Server was a nice kid. Very polite.

I think they could do more with atmosphere and highlighting the history of the place, as I was just as interested in the food as that.

I immediately had Rainbow bar and grill vibes when I walked in (L.A.), and I think if they invested in hanging memorabilia and catering to the Limelight's vast array of history and famous guests with photos, decor, and more seating I think it could be really, really cool.",4

We ordered the gambas and the paella and both were incredibly salty. It was almost as if they marinate their shrimp in salt.

The gambas, it was so salty I thought I was just eating salt with a side of shrimp and bread
The paella- same thing. Their shrimp was over salted and the rice was bland. Overall the balance of both these dishes were not it.

Service and atmosphere was great. If the food was better it would have been perfect.",2

We decided to go with the Chef's Menu - The Classics, which put less pressure on everyone to choose a dish. We were blown away at how each bite that arrived was just as delicious as the next.

The paella was perfect as well, they surely know how to make it leaving the socarrat at the end of the pan. I finally found a good paella around this area and I‚Äôm a fan. Also service was great.

- Black Truffle Pizza ($30+)

I‚Äôm not a fan of truffle, but the Black Truffle Pizza with fontina cheese and farm egg was so good.

My only disappointment was the Organic Young Thai Coconut Water ($10+), which came in a glass, not coconut. It was good, but I wouldn‚Äôt order it again.

Food was out of this world with rapid service and quality eats. Butternut squash soup, chrysanthemum salad, fluke tartar all hits. Mushroom pizza was delightful, so delicate. And the chai cr√®me br√ªl√®e is what dreams are made of.
If you drink, try the abc kitchen Manhattan and close off with a glass of sambuca. I order mine with ice water and dilute it a little bit but it‚Äôs completely up to your taste. I simply find adding an ice cube enhances the flavor.

The restaurant looks and feels very old school American Italian but it also feels new. It's almost like they created the restaurant 2-3 years ago to look like it opened in the early 2000s.

The service at the restaurant was great. Everyone was very attentive, knowledgable, courteous. The prices were also mostly reasonable.

We shared a pizza to start with pureed butternut squash, mushroom, and mozzarella. For my entree, I had a special pasta with mushrooms in a cream sauce. The food was fine! Not amazing, not bad.

I do not know that I would go back to this restaurant. I did not have a bad experience, but I do not know that I would initiate a return. There are many other Italian restaurants in Manhattan that I would like to try or return to before coming back to this establishment.",3

92,abc cocina,"38 E 19th St, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.3,Alex Liu,"Out of the abc line of restaurants in this area, I found this to be the least exciting one. I tried the tuna tartare, arroz con pollo, and churros.

The tuna was kind of‚Ä¶ dull? It was still pretty fresh, but all the flavors kind of muddled together. Also, the tuna looked like it was smashed or something, which I guess made it soft to the bite, but I found it soft to the point of being almost mushy, which was unappetizing.

The arroz con pollo was rather unremarkable. Yes, the chicken was very tender. Yes, the skin was crispy. But the rice was also on the verge of mushy (sensing a theme here), and there didn‚Äôt really seem to be anything else with the dish to liven it up. I got a little tired of spooning the chicken rice mash into my mouth. Also, there was hot sauce, but it was very mild for a Mexican restaurant, which was a bit sad.

The churros were fine. They were quite tasty, even, and I really enjoyed the melted chocolate it came with. However, the churros also crumbled easily, rather than staying crisp, so by the end I could have used a spoon to fish out the bits that broke off into the chocolate sauce.

All in all, if you want Mexican food, there are plenty of places in the city with way more lively dishes, especially if you‚Äôre going to be paying these prices.",3

After the dinner I asked the waiter to bring out the cake, they said they will charge $6 each for our cake, I think it was ridiculous that they charge for cutting the cake for this kind of casual dining restaurant. Most restaurant don‚Äôt charge that anymore because of the economy. Anyway I asked the waiter if they can waived the fees, I can just order more dessert to make it up. The waiter asked the chef (or owner?) and they said no. My 11 years old niece was so disappointed that she cannot have her cake. Anyway I will not come back again. Good luck with your business.",1

Delicious pasta dishes, both the Spaghetti carbonara and the Fussili a la Normina. Very good Tiramisu as well. Staff was professional and the service was very good. The main reason not to put the five star is because of the 'Non-cash additional charge of $5,19' which I find very annoying. I get that banks charge businesses for credit card transactions, and that should be part of the restaurant's operating costs and reflected in the dish prices. But I don't see why as a customer I have to be the one paying for that extra fee, or be pushed to pay in cash. I've got news, we are heading towards a cash-less society, with every payment being electronic, so come into the 21st century please.",4

My bowl was made of cardboard and so was the cover. The plastic spoon was even biodegradable too.they post the calories of every salad so you can watch your caloric intake.

We got off to a bad start when the initial waitstaff (a tallish woman) decided to correct my pronunciation of an appetizer. Didn't think anything of it at first, but then I thought of all the restaurants my wife have eaten at through the years in Italy (Rome, Palermo, Mondello, Naples) and never once was corrected (and I'm sure we flubbed some dishes we ordered). We are of Italian heritage, but not fluent in Italian. The arrogance really began to grate on me because when the food arrived after an extended wait it was nothing to write home about. To make maters worse the service was nonexistent. After the initial seating we had different wait staff and he was elusive. Took the main course order and was never to be seen again. If the place was crowded I could understand, however, we were one of four tables. Arancini as an appetizer...mediocre. Main courses the same. The Tagliatelle alla Bolognese was decent, but not $29 decent. Expected much better.  The pizza, Burrata e Pomodoro, to say I've had better would be an understatement. Local corner Pizzerias in Brooklyn put it to shame. Will continue to go to the market, but will never set foot in the restaurant again. Such a letdown.",2

Serving size is good too. I had the pasta carbonara and it was very filling I ended up taking half of it home. Portions are not huge but more than adequate. The one thing I will make note of especially if you have young kids is that the menu is not American friendly. Soda is from Italy and yes it does taste just like Coca-Cola but it may throw some of your kids off. Also, no chicken nuggets or anything like that. As long as your kids eat pasta and pizza you are good to go. I highly recommend this place food was amazing.",5

Our 13 y/o daughter can be pretty picky, and even she was blown away. Our group had a pizza, fettuccine, and ravioli after starting with bread and some fried risotto balls. Everything was exquisite. We all shared and sampled and it was all simply fresh, and delicious. Well balanced, well seasoned, and presented beautifully. For dessert we shared a gelato and a tiramisu. Now I will say... I normally avoid tiramisu. I never had one I really enjoyed ..... Well, I have now. The tiramisu was phenomenal!

You have some amazing and flavorful Italian classics on the menu, but even basics like focaccia seem to be out every time we go.  It‚Äôs chaos from the moment you try to check in at the host stand to getting you to your packed and crowded table and then good luck eventually getting your order taken and your food served.  Things like drink refills are a dream - and this is during a weekday mid-afternoon when it should be slower.

We ordered the ramen soup since they advertised their association with Setagaya.   The soup ramen is the step child here. You had to order from the kiosk, and you would only receive a small cheap plastic bowl with burning hot ramen soup.   If it it a fast food place, I would say the ramen is acceptable; however, the price says otherwise.   I like the deco and the general concept, but not how the store is run.  Will not be back here.",3

There are couple of times the seaweed packs wasn‚Äôt given when we added the grab rolls order. If the grab roll is signature item in this restaurant with average $10 per piece. The seaweed packs should be accompanied to complete the order without excuses!! It‚Äôs annoying to have to ask.  Also the kitchen is close at 9:30. While we are still eating, the prep stations are being cleaned up‚Ä¶‚Ä¶stacking containers, mopping counters etc. making the diners feeling rushed.

Reservations were made for three on Open Table, and when we arrived we were seated right away. As per previous reviews JLC is dimly lit, going for the trendy chic vibe.

The restaurant week offer was 3 courses for $45. We went with three different appetizers and shared.
Crispy Rock Shrimp Tempura, Vegetable Spring Rolls and Crispy Chicken Wontons. The top two were the chicken wontons and rock shrimp. For an entr√©e I chose the slow cooked glazed salmon and so did a friend. I was not impressed and truthful neither was my friend. The salmon was slightly overcooked rendering it a tad dry and I was not pleased with the glaze. Another dining companion order the Pow Pow Beef and was in-love, too bad I don't eat beef.

For desserts we tried the Chocolate Lava Cake and Everyday's Your Birthday Cake, the ladder was also dry. The cocktails we tried were the Dusse Sidecar & Lychee Martini both were very tasty @ $20 a glass.

Overall give them a try if you haven't already, the apps were a hit. Keep in mind it is Asian cuisine on the higher end in retrospect to what one may expect.

For instance, we just finished the last chip in the starter and table was cleared for the sizzling mac and cheese that we heard making it's way from the kitchen. I appreciate the attention to detail. In other restaurants, I hate waiting too long because I feel like I'm going to be there all night and I can't stand being rushed so staff can flip the table. They made us feel welcome but it seems they understood that we don't live there lol. My favorite part is being allowed to rest our food after this culinary experience! It wasn't difficult to ask for the check and they brought us our bags the moment we stood up without us asking. Reminds me of the quality of service I grew up with experiencing on Mulberry street in the 90s. Comfortable, delicious, genuinely warm/welcoming, and easy going but attentive. I didn't think I'd encounter the quality of service we received in this place. Not that I doubted them specifically! Lol. It's just so rare to have a pleasant experience from beginning to end. The d√©cor definitely adds to that 90s NYC vibe but it's part of its charm. So that's a plus, for me. Nostalgic but not completely outdated.

The entire staff collaborated very well together to tend to every table. I was advised to reserve a table but I'm not sure we needed to because we dined early at 6pm. But the reservation didn't hurt. If you eat the way we did, be prepared to spend a pretty penny if you visit with a party of 4+ even if no one drinks. For the quality of food, I find it pretty affordable if your group just gets one dish each because times are hard. In this economy? Sometimes we have to make sacrifices lol. But if you can hack it, try as many dishes as you can possibly afford lol. Great wine selections, also!

A huge thank you to the staff at Le Zie for making my mother's 69th birthday dinner a memorable one. I hope to be back soon for the Chicken Liver P√¢t√© Crostini and Yellowfin Tuna Ravioli!",5

You would most likely need a reservation here for peek dinner times. The food and wine selection were extensive and we liked the quality of the food. The restaurant was a bit on the louder side and the atmosphere wasn‚Äôt very intimate, which makes it better for group dinners and less so for date nights",5

We had a party of 7 and everyone was satisfied with their orders, antipasti were good too (we got octopus salad and mix of fried calamari, shrimp and zucchini). Deserts were great, we ordered big selection of them for the table and shared, so I had a chance to sample many and each of them I‚Äôd order again.

Slight minus of the place is that servers are a bit slow to attend. We spilled water on the table and it took a while before someone finally collected wet napkins from us and attended to the table. However, besides that I have no complaints. Waiter was friendly, provided us with great recommendations, food came quickly. It‚Äôs a pricy place but totally worth it, good food guaranteed.",4

Not necessarily considered fine dining but right below it. I‚Äôve personally had better tasting Italian food at other places but this one is still decent. The waitress and host were very nice.
The downside to this restaurant is the long wait times. Expect to wait an hour on average if you do not have a reservation. My personal experience is that I did not have a reservation and walked in on a Friday night which was to be expected. That resulted in a very long wait. However, I did observe other parties that had a reservation, either big or small, still waiting for a table. It goes to show that it is a nice place to eat at and to plan accordingly. Otherwise it‚Äôs a decent spot.",3

Went to pick up lunch. No line, easy fast in and out from the store. Loved the salad, eggplant, chicken shawarma. The bowl came with pita bread too. It was a filling quantity. Sadly, didn‚Äôt like the rice much, would have nice if it was warmer.

The restaurant has lots of space. There are high chairs in front of the glass front. There are tables in the back of the restaurant. Comfortable space to seat and dine.",5

I started off with asking for their house white wine. Can‚Äôt recall the ambit it was crisp and refreshing, perfect for a lunch meal. Although at $18/glass, you might think twice.

The octopus dish had one flavor:burnt. I didn‚Äôt taste anything else. That was a bummer. The spaghetti with clams was out of this world deliciousness it saved the entire experience. Perfectly executed. It may very well be the best spaghetti dish I‚Äôve ever had. The bucatini was also perfectly cooked.

Overall, solid but felt rushed and uneasy, partly because of me but also with the staff running around the restaurant. It‚Äôs not a cheap venue so my expectation will be high. Will return as I think this is a one off and the restaurant probably deserves a 5*.",4

This restaurant was great just because of the food that the Execute Chef prepared, but the manager, all the servers and house staff rendered superior service! For this quality of food and service you would expect to pay an absorbent price! But for a three course meal with a refillable coke, it was under $60!

Service is pretty fast and efficient and I loved all of the dishes I tried. The mezze is wonderful with the fresh bread - especially the smoked trout! I went with the crab benedict which was pretty good overall. I will say I was expecting a crab-cake as opposed to the crab-meat on creamed spinach but I still did enjoy the flavors. Would definitely want to try more on the menu the next time I'm back!,4
249,Barbounia,"250 Park Ave S, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.4,Ana Llapa,"My hubby booked a reservation at 5pm, we arrived at 430pm and they seated us.  This was perfect as the restaurant was just getting ready for dinner time.  We ordered our drinks first and waited to order our food.  The drinks were delicious! I ordered the Smoking Fruit and it was perfect! My hubby ordered the Caribbean Old Fashioned, needless to say he was also happy with his drink.
Appetizers were great we had grilled Portuguese octopus.  It was cooked to perfection and was a good portion! All I can say is scrumptious yummyness! Then my hubby had a beef soup which was the special of the day.  He was happy either way it! Again I thought it was a tad bit salty.
For our entrees i had the grilled Atlantic salmon. It was perfectly grilled to retain its moisture and flavor.  It was perfectly paired with baby Brussel sprouts, radishes and earthy wild mushrooms.  The black truffle vinaigrette added some savory notes, fully completing the dish!  My hubby ordered the slow cooked short rib tagine. The meat was tender and succulent infused with delicious spices.  He loved it! I thought it was just a tad salty.  The homemade couscous was fluffy and just delicious, paired perfectly with the short rib.
The atmosphere was wonderful!! Beautifully decorated and just great.  It was nice especially because we came early! By the time we left, it was full. We will definitely return to try other dishes or maybe just have a drink at the bar.",5

251,Barbounia,"250 Park Ave S, New York, NY 10003, USA",4.4,A N,"Had a lovely visit here for lunch right around the time they opened.
The ambiance, food, and service were all immaculate.
Highly recommend starting with the Cauliflower (a true appetizer featuring 3 different ‚Äúsauces‚Äù that expands your appetite and look forward to future courses). The Shakshuka was excellent, make sure to get it with the house bread crusted with thyme and rosemary. I enjoyed it with a glass of the Rioja Iberico which completed the food perfectly. I will be dreaming about this dish for a while. And finally close off with the rose water pannacotta (with a side of saint germain elderflower liquor).
The true artistry here is that all the dishes on the menu and that I ordered all are so cohesive with one another with each dish ‚Äúflowing‚Äù into the next seamlessly. There‚Äôs clear connection in food profiles but substantial differences in the flavors where there is no monotony in what you‚Äôre consuming.

257,b≈çm,"17 W 19th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.8,ricky chang,"I wanted to like this restaurant, I really did.

The total cost was well over Per Se, Cote and Blue Hill at Stone Barns and Jean Georges.  So be mindful of that.  That said I don‚Äôt think it was worth it because of the dining environment.

The service was on point. Caring but not intrusive. Not condescending as some other fine dining restaurants may be. Staff was all knowledgeable and easy to chat with.

Food was very good and watching them cook was equally as entertaining. Each dish was prepared with passion, effort and patience.

What made me dislike the restaurant, and I can‚Äôt completely fault them for this, is there was a group of 4 next to us that was just causing an absolute ruckus. It was loud.  Fast food type loud.  While it‚Äôs not entirely their fault they should‚Äôve made some sort of effort to calm them down or ask them to bring it down just a touch.

While the cooking and food preparation was there for me the atmosphere just didn‚Äôt do it for me. If you‚Äôre going to spend this much I recommend Blue Hill which has a certain clientele that it attracts.",3
258,b≈çm,"17 W 19th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.8,Victoria Geh,"One of the greatest displays of culinary maximalism I have ever tasted. Everything was delicately crafted with fine dining staples that all lead into mind blowing steak courses.

The amuse bouche opened with toro and caviar. The toro course had soft, tender, well-marinated tuna enclosed in a crunchy shell of seaweed which made for a contrasting combination of textures. Didn‚Äôt really taste the foie gras, but the toro still made for a perfect first bite. The baesuk picked up the tactile theme and had apple, tofu, and trout roe balancing textures and flavors within a crisp shell. The richness of the caviar was highlighted by the sweetness of the apple; the softness of the tofu was enriched by the brittle crisp of the shell. Incredible first bites.

Continuing with seafood courses, the prawn was a delicate concoction with lots of moving parts meshing well with each other. The course was small, pretty, and presented in an elegant black bowl. The kimchi ssam bundled prawn, wagyu, and octopus together into one course. The wrapped ingredients lent themselves to a one dimensional flavor, but the textures worked together well. The ssam sat in a refreshing juice that was meticulously paired with the savory flavors of the beef and prawn, but the course following it had more complexity. Leading into the next course, the kerang jjim had such layered flavors with a generous amount of king crab resting atop an airy fluffy bed of egg. Closing the seafood courses was the fish, yet the highlight of this bite was the seaweed. Seaweed paired with uni trained the spotlight on the taste of seaweed without overshadowing the uni. The fish was solid, tender, and topped with scallion oil, and the touch of burdock was a great detail. As a whole, the seafood courses built on each other, each one adding flavors from a wide variety of familiar fine dining ingredients. Yet, the meat courses did what the seafood courses did for each other, incorporating familiar flavors to bring a perfectly balanced umami.

The meat dishes were where you can see the chef‚Äôs clear vision and acumen. You‚Äôre served a wet aged and a dry aged filet mignon side by side. The wet-aged filet is topped with uni that is sweet and fresh, and the dry-aged filet has buttery and flavorful caviar atop a perfect medium rare. The generous amounts of uni, caviar and salt perfectly season each steak, balancing the saltiness inherent in the two seafood pairings. After the filets, galbi with rice made for a soul warming bite. The freshly grated wasabi was refreshing, not spicy and made for the perfect midpoint of the meal. The last meat course was the 21 day dry aged rib eye served with a truffle puree and sweet potato. First thoughts were that there was such a deep flavor in the meat, then the sweet potato drew more attention. The edges of the potato were the consistency of a perfect
McDonald‚Äôs fry with its crunch and texture. Following the meats was a fairly forgettable banchan course that featured wagyu in a light and flavorful clear broth but acted as a needed deescalation from the meat course highlights.

Desserts were strawberry sorbet with sour Korean strawberries and a deconstructed apple pie a la mode. The sorbet was a kind of palate cleanser and the dessert was decent overall. Everything in the meal was rich and sublime. Every ingredient felt at home in a fine dining context. Every meat was aged, cooked, and paired with its seafood perfectly. 10/10 would go back.",5
259,b≈çm,"17 W 19th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.8,Patrick Wong,"TLDR: Bom gets it right. While a bit of a splurge, it's the right balance of a celebratory meal that feels luxurious yet still refined. For a beef-centric meal, you won't have crazy meat sweats but you'll still feel like you got your money's worth.

Tucked behind of Oiji Mi - I'm surprised it's taken me this long to write this review. For a tasting that's got beef top of mind, it's not overly beefy. In fact, the first several courses showcase the team's skill with seafood dishes.

The starter plate with a crispy seaweed tartare bite, two caviar-esque tartlets, a marinated sashimi component. You might actually think this was a kaiseki/omakase meal if it were not the Frenchy elements.

As you progress through the first parts of the meal, your proteins for the evening are showcased and are grilled table side as you make your way to the beef portion. A steamed-egg custard with crab, it almost tastes like a Cantonese dish. An abalone plate with wild rice, a ginger scallion fish with broth. You almost forget that this is a beef-themed tasting and then, that part arrives.

Two pieces one with sea urchin roe and the other with caviar. So tender, salty, briny, perfect. Next a rice bowl with ikura, gamtae seaweed, marinated beef. Mix it up and enjoy. After a beef course with fermented veggies, then the wagyu which is served more French-ish. The final savory part was a tray with rice, crispy seaweed, soup, all different types of sauces to make miniature hand rolls if you will.

The desserts were just as good as the savory part. Again, more of a special occasion kind of spot but it's a proper way to splurge.",5
260,b≈çm,"17 W 19th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.8,Amy Shin,"This spot wins first place as far as Korean fine dining goes. The explanation of each beef cut really enhanced the overall taste and experience, especially when comparing dry and wet aged side to side. My only comment is that the dessert was slightly disappointing- not as good as Oiji Mi. While the overall quality of the main dishes were over the roof, the only thing they lacked was the dessert. But overall, a great meal!",5
261,b≈çm,"17 W 19th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.8,Nathaniel J. Padre,"I‚Äôve been to most Korean fine dining restaurants in the city and I can comfortably say that the majority of the b≈çm menu was as good as some of the best experiences I‚Äôve had. However, not sure if the entire menu was worth.

My favorites of the current menu were: the bluefin tuna ‚Äútaco‚Äù; the sablefish with daikon broth and meyer lemon; the nuruk-aged beef with caviar; the wagyu galbi; and the dry aged beef. I think the nuruk-aged beef was probably one of the best bites of beef I have ever had.

For me, experience felt two Michelin - until I had the hansang charim. I was a little confused; after all the amazing food and the buildup we had, the savory courses ended with a daikon beef soup, rice, and kimchi. It was like an elevated version of what I had at my friend‚Äôs places growing up and while I appreciated the nostalgia, I felt as if there was no climax to the meal after all the crescendo. I will say that I needed the bulk of the soup and rice to make me full.

While I thought the desserts were good, I think that Oiji Mi‚Äôs are better.

Overall, some of the best bites I‚Äôve had so I‚Äôm giving it 5 stars, but for cheaper or equivalent price, I think you should try the other Korean fine dining places in NYC first or maybe wait another season to try b≈çm.",5

Thankfully, the experience lived up to most of them. The interior is simple yet elegant, without any pretentious or tacky elements. The host was friendly and welcoming, and the service was quick and flawless overall. I was seated at the bar, which offers the same dinner menu options. The bartender was polite, accommodating, and a genuinely nice guy.

However, the only aspect that didn't meet my expectations was the food itself. I ordered the pasta dish called ""Grandma walking through the forest,"" and while it was okay, it didn't taste particularly delicious. In all honesty, I've had much better pasta in my life. The cheese for dessert was good, especially when paired with the selection of additional items like nuts, crackers, and jam. Considering the relatively high price (two dishes and two glasses of Prosecco for over 100 dollars), I would have expected more impressive food. Despite this, it was still a pleasant experience.",4

I was struggling to finish the dish, and felt unpleasant eating it. Bread would be a must with that one. The cured meat served with the dish was just too salty and did not work. The main dishes were disappointing. I had the ‚Äúmodenese vacationing in rome‚Äù. It was dry, salty, loaded with cheese. Not to mention quite a small portion. I‚Äôve had better pasta almost anywhere else. My friend had the verde on verde on verde. Cool name but he said it was not good. Lastly, the dessert. We had all four flavors of gelato on the menu. The olive oil ice cream was horrible. Why is that a thing? Two of the other flavors were really good, but I couldn‚Äôt even tell which was which. Maybe a skill issue on our end. Overall, terribly overpriced for the quality of food we were served. The service was nice and it was packed around 12:30 pm on Saturday. Reservations seem the way to go if you want to come still.

We started with the mozzarella di bufala DOP (8/10) and garlic bread (8.5/10), gnocco fritto (really amazing) (9/10) and worked our way to two primi pastas - gramigna giallo e verde (8/10) and also tried the grandma walking through the forest with Emilia ( creative and well crafted but wasn‚Äôt my flavor profile very creamy and heavy 6/10) and ended with cow grazing in Emilia romagna (9/10) and the black bass (felt over cooked and too greasy /salty 4/10) and the sunchoke millefoglie (8/10).

282,odo,"17 W 20th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.5,Priscilla V,"The chefs counter experience at odo is very intimate with a small number of diners, direct view of the food prep, and a very kind host. Time really flies quickly.

The food is very down to earth, light, and doesn‚Äôt leave you overly full. Sashimi is very good. I think most things are not heavily seasoned and you‚Äôre left to find the natural flavours of the ingredients. It‚Äôs a nice experience but I would just left wanting a bit more given the price tag and comparing to other tasting menus at this range. The non alcoholic menu is very decent.",4
283,odo,"17 W 20th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.5,ÂïµÊ≥•ÂÑøBonnie,"I was just very disappointed by the quality of the lunch menu. The Long Island duck was tough. I chewed the piece for 30 seconds and decided not to swallow. Felt guilty for wasting the food. The mushroom sides were not pairing at all. I don‚Äôt event want to mention the plating of this dish (p1). The uni over egg has strong citrus flavor. It was too strong that covered the sweetness of the uni. The dessert was also disappointing. Even though it may have better ingredients, there is nothing more but McDonald Strawberry Sundays. The other dishes were not bad, but not stunning.

I understand that Odo wants to attract more customers with her lunch menu, but this is just very disappointing and making alternative effects to the customers. As a Michelin star restaurant, this menu is totally foolish. As a foodie, I really recommend the restaurant to remove this session and focus more on the high-end dinner sessions.

When people take a 6-hour flight from Los Angeles only for your dish, this menu should not exist.",1

The dishes were on the lighter side and the freshness / quality of the ingredients really shines. Everything was immaculately prepared to perfection with the right combination of ingredients. I thought the lunch was a good deal, if you are not ready to commit $300+ I suggest giving their lunch a try.

Open kitchen was a nice touch too, so fun to watch.",5
285,odo,"17 W 20th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.5,Tim C.,"The restaurant is such a great hidden gem. It‚Äôs hard to find at first since it‚Äôs hidden behind a bar.  After noticing several details there I really appreciated the incredible design of the space.

The counter seating is amazing with great intimacy allowing views of the chefs that prepare the food right in front of you.  All of the dishes are prepared with incredible precision and the flavor combinations are simply perfect.  The server for the evening was incredibly knowledgeable and the hospitality was just amazing.  At the end of the meal, chef Odo even threw in a little bit of extra special treat with the left over rice for us to take home.

Unfortunately, the evening was ruined by two incredibly rude diners next to us who had loud conversations and even took a phone call during meal service.  Thankfully the incredible hospitality and food more than made up for it.

All in all it was such an amazing experience and I would highly recommend this place! We will be back for more!",5
286,odo,"17 W 20th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.5,Joyce Lang,"After entering the Hall, you will be guided to the speakeasy chef counter. The Chawanmushi is the best I have ever had topped with fresh sweet sea urchins from Hokkaido and lightly salty firm white sturgeon caviar still cool though sit in the warm soup. Tender peeled asparagus (could be the root ;)) add that touch of spring right away. When started to scoop up the soup, I started to realize there is more to enjoy the sweet delicate Crab meet thin strings. There are more crab strings mixed in the smooth and silky egg custard. The appetizer also has a dash of orange peel which added a hearty and flavourful twist to the dish in addition to the hair thin scallion and other herbs. From colour, presentation to taste, it is a spring delight to enjoy. The only minor thing is I wish they provided a mother pearl spoon instead of a wood spoon to enjoy it.",4
287,Oiji Mi,"17 W 19th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.6,Clara R.,"I came here for my birthday dinner. The staff here were so friendly and helpful. They explained the tasting course thoroughly. The first course was a set of three little dishes and the rest was a sort of ""choose your own adventure"" type of thing. My brother, husband and I each ordered something different and we got to try most of the menu that way. The presentation was impeccable and the food was top notch. They presented me with a cute little birthday dessert with a candle. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.",5
288,Oiji Mi,"17 W 19th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.6,Mandy,"We had an amazing dinner at Oiji Mi. Starting with 3 appetizers, all of them were excellent! My favorite was scallops with prawn. Bossam for 2 people came with oysters, and it was melting in my mouth. My octopus soup with noodles was one of the best dishes! The duck was very savory and sea bass was so crispy and the broth was really good.
Service was amazing as well. Everyone was so attentive and all the dishes were delivered very smoothly.
Highly highly recommended üëåüèª",5
289,Oiji Mi,"17 W 19th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.6,Nicolas Arauz,"We stopped in without a reservation and were lucky to get a seat at the bar, this is a place that has been on our list since it opened and it did NOT disappoint. It was crowded on a Friday night.

Cocktails were a little on the sweet side, but well balanced; the wine list is well matched to the menu and of course they give expert advice. Staff was very attentive friendly and positive from start to finish.

The food was inventive, beautifully plated, perfectly seasoned and with just the right amount of heat. We did the five course tasting menu which is worth it for the first visit; if we went back I'd focus on a few key dishes. It's expensive but not out of bounds for the quality nor for a Michelin star restaurant in NYC.",5
290,Oiji Mi,"17 W 19th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.6,Paula,"I have been on a Korean cuisine kick lately and Oiji Mi doesn't disappoint. Their modern twist on Korean flavors was splendid, in addition to A+ service; the waiters were extremely knowledgeable about both the food and drinks being served. Additionally, the atmosphere and interior decor pleased the eye. I would definitely recommend this place and would eat here again.",5
291,Oiji Mi,"17 W 19th St, New York, NY 10011, USA",4.6,Mel J,"We came for dinner and had a great time. Too start, the cocktail list has plenty of good options  - our favorites were the 'lily' one which is fresh, floral with pisco, and the 'coniferous flip' mezcal one.
To start, everyone gets a three dish appetizer consisting of a bite of beef tartare, anchovy and pea egg custard, and prawn.
For the next four courses you have a choice from three options. We enjoyed the bo ssam with oyster, then the lobster ramyum and the Oiji Mi bowl with uni and shrimp on seaweed rice, and then the main entrees of dry aged duck and sea bass. Both came with flavorful broths which were delicious.
For dessert, we had the bingsu and the chocolate taco.
Service was attentive and polite. We had a great time and will be back!",5
292,Chipotle Mexican Grill,"680 6th Ave, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.0,Nehal Ahmed,"I recently started getting my lunches from this Chipotle. So far it has been a good experience. Ingredients are mostly fresh. I don‚Äôt get charged for salad dressing, which is a good sign. I go there before noon to avoid the peak rush hours.

But I have noticed the amount of Guacamole I get is inconsistent. Last time I got barely more than a quarter of a spoon. I have noticed this at other Chipotle too, you are at the mercy of whoever is serving you your bowl. But I get charged $3 regardless. Chipotle needs to come up with special Guacamole spoon to make it a standard.

The store is mostly clean and we maintained. There‚Äôs a nice seating area for dining in.",4
293,Chipotle Mexican Grill,"680 6th Ave, New York, NY 10010, USA",4.0,Freddie,"Go here after night class sometimes cuz it's open so late but the foods usually pretty bad. Edible but I only really go here cuz it's convient. It's disgusting inside, luckily I usually take my food to go. Today was like insane. Trash bin overflowing and trash everywhere when you walk in. (more the customers fault than the employees ig but still they should change out the bag if it's full). I was actually gonna sit in and eat that day but it was it was pretty packed and again it was disgusting. Also they just forgot who it my order for a minute, made my burrito wrapped it up and put it on the side. And then rang up a person behind me. And then when I was having trouble with my card they just kinda sat there. I have empathy as someone who worked in food and bev as they probably had a long shift but geez I think it was enough for me not to want to go back. I mean it's 12 dollars for a burrito!
Also since they make it fresh, I've had a few times where they're out of chicken when I go. It is usually 8 or 9 PM when I go so I can excuse that. But if you go be prepared for that.
go here if you really need a bite and nothing else is open. If you don't care about mediocre service you should be okay",2

After I approached them, they ignored me and took two other customers without any direction, asked back for my name and location several times to finally print the receipt and make my order. 15 minutes after the promised time. No apologies, No explaination, not a word. Irresponsible and unkind staff.",1

Also, at this location, they are inconsistent with their portions. I remember when Chipotle was one of the best chains in NY. Chipotle, it's time to up your game.",1
