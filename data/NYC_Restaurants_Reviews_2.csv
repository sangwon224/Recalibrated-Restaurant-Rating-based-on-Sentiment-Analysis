The staff are helpful and friendly! I HIGHLY recommend this place!

Anything you order you will LOVE!",5
2,Siena Cafe ‚Ä¢ Italian ‚Ä¢ Bar ‚Ä¢ Restaurant,"1580 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.2,Giang Nguyen,"I had the avocado toast around 3pm on a Sunday afternoon after being out playing sports on a mostly empty stomach for the entire morning. The avocado toast was heavenly. Perhaps partly due to my starvation and exhaustion ü§£ (The avocado on a separate plate was an ""extra"" that I ordered -- $4).

No, but more seriously, the toast had the right amount of crunchiness, the smashed avocado had the right amount of salt and sweetness, and the veggies contributed a nice hint of sourness. Overall, very satisfying.

The iced coffee with milk and no sugar was also delicious. Can one associate deliciousness with coffee? I don't know but that was how it felt üòÑ

5 ‚≠ê overall despite a 3 ‚≠ê for service -- the server didn't do anything wrong, but I just didn't feel very welcome ü§£",5

I love my salad but for my friend who ordered salmon risotto was totally off there is no risotto just a rice and salmon by itself was great. Service was super slow because of the to go orders and server needs to train more but ambience was great such a cute restaurant,2

5,Siena Cafe ‚Ä¢ Italian ‚Ä¢ Bar ‚Ä¢ Restaurant,"1580 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.2,Sabrina Anikina,"Went here for a date night on a weekday. The ambience and service were good. The food didn't live up to the hype. The bread basket was stale bread. The pesto gnocchi had little flavor, the pesto needed more salt or cheese. The seafood in the risotto was overcooked and dry. The scallop dish was luke warm and the scallops were also overcooked. Not sure if it was an off night.",3
6,Lex Restaurant,"1370 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.6,Mac Maccer,"Definitely not recommending this place. The waiter was very pushy in upselling the food. Food was okay but not to come back for. It was lacking freshness and vibrance. Prices are too high for what is presented. The restroom was not clean, no towel(s) and very smelly. We had to take our own coats when we were leaving. The television(!!!!) at the bar was an annoying distraction. The courtesy to say goodbye from staff was not there. We went here because of the positive reviews. But this place has had its best days long ago‚Ä¶",2
7,Lex Restaurant,"1370 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.6,Emma Duncan,We had a great time and a great food with friends! Would to come again and definitely will do!,5
8,Lex Restaurant,"1370 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.6,William Ho,"A traditional Italian restaurant with excellent service and good food. We sat at the outdoor heated seating, which was very comfortable but have also previously dined indoors. The indoor decor is very cozy. The seafood risotto was excellent, and the veal piccata was tender and well marinated. We ordered the special dessert for the day (apple crumble pie with ice cream) and the warm chocolate brownie with ice cream. Both desserts were super yummy.",5
9,Lex Restaurant,"1370 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.6,Brandon,"Absolutely phenomenal restaurant. The food here is amazing but most importantly, the service is excellent. The food came out in a perfectly timed manner and the staff made sure I was well taken care of.",5
10,Lex Restaurant,"1370 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.6,Melissa K,"Quaint little place we decided to stop at as we had time to kill before an event! The staff was super friendly, the food was amazing and perfect portion sizes - not too small that you're still hungry but not too big that you can't finish. The place feels on the fancy side and the prices are what you'd expect. Overall, worth it and when we're back down to the city, we'll definitely come back!",5
11,Paola's,"1361 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.5,Marco Bottero,"A real gem.
I am very picky when it comes to Italian food having grown up in an Italian family.  You would think New York City is full of great Italian restaurants. I have discovered that is not the case, until I ate at Paola‚Äôs restaurant.
Paola‚Äôs delivers an authentic and delicious meal with a unique menu and accessible wine list.
I also loved the simple but all home made deserts.
Definitely my favorite Italian restaurant in all of New York.",5
12,Paola's,"1361 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.5,Sub Bot,"Great food, if a bit on the pricy side. Ordering takeout is always a great option from Paola's! The bread is sometimes stale, so if you're not there in person you may want to get some of your own to go with your dinner.",5
13,Paola's,"1361 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.5,Benjamin Sommer,"Paola‚Äôs is a fabulous upscale restaurant that recently relocated from Madison Avenue to Lexington Avenue. Let me break down our most recent meal. We started off with the warm mozzarella which is hands down the best in the city. The portion is a bit small but the taste makes up for it. We also started with the Arugula Salad which is always very good. For main courses we ordered the salmon, branzino, the veal and the pesto which we got to share. Both fish dishes were a relatively big portion and were very tasty. The veal was small but tasted really great and so did the potatoes that came along with it. Finally, the pesto was a pretty small portion, but very good. For dessert, the cappuccino was just the right size however it could have been a little warmer. We also got the tiramisu which was so so good. Finally the biscottis were just the right thing to top off the fabulous meal. Overall a great experience. 5 stars.",5
14,Paola's,"1361 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.5,Marcus Krieg,"I was not prepared for how amazing the food and experience would be. We ordered a shared appetizer and two entrees and the waiter KNEW we were going to share and offered to bring them out one at a time.

We had a wonderful meal and every item was prepared perfectly. We had the meatballs, ravioli and pappardelle and all of it was literally perfect bite and texture. Perfectly timed, perfectly prepared. Can‚Äôt rave enough except to rue my lack of appetite for dessert ",5
15,Paola's,"1361 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.5,SkyHighCheif,"We ate here a year ago & really liked it,however last week was really bad. Pasta was terrible. Service was a joke. We asked for our drinks 3 times. After a 20 min wait for drinks they told us they did not know how to make cocktails. The staff were arguing with each other constantly. Also the staff were eating right in front of us all night. One server was loudly coughing into his hands & never saw him wash his hands once. Just so disappointing because we used to really like this place.",2
16,La Vita,"1670 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.4,Kaitlin Roberts,I was feeling like trying a new place and omg - I‚Äôm so glad I did. Everything was fresh and delicious and HOT. I‚Äôm so happy right now lol consider me a regular!,5
17,La Vita,"1670 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.4,Sam Ts,Save your money. Super dry pizza lacking any flavor. Tastes like cardboard. There‚Äôs better pizza spots around the area. lol $5.40 for this tiny slice of pizza.,1
18,La Vita,"1670 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.4,Karina Ortega,The best pastas in the Upper East Side!!! They have great customer service and their food is 5 stars. I get lunch from them almost everyday. I even got my co workers into this place! Lol... And their prices are very good for the portions they serve you. Great place to eat in and great people that work there. I highly recommend to everyone.,5
19,La Vita,"1670 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.4,Mikael C,Love the food here!! Love the customer service always so friendly ! You have to try their margarita pizza. I‚Äôve ordered from here constantly 10-15 times,5
20,La Vita,"1670 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.4,Samantha Nicole,"I ordered for delivery . Delivery didn‚Äôt want to come up after I let him know I wasn‚Äôt able to come down because I had a sleeping baby so I just went down got down with not even a min after hanging up and he wasn‚Äôt there I called store I called him he kept saying he was outside when I was down stairs for 20 min he never was there the store tried to say he said he can‚Äôt come
Up because he has problems in the building ‚Ä¶ ( I do not live on ‚Äúdangerous ‚Äú block ) but he just left because I was not outside which wasn‚Äôt true .. and he will be back infront in 2 min‚Ä¶ he never came I kept calling the store for them to say to order Uber eats they can‚Äôt get hold of driver or come pick it up ‚Ä¶ like what",1
21,Midnight Express Diner,"1715 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.2,Nicole Kelly,Who serves half a fried chicken WITH BONE in it for chicken and waffles?!? Did not expect that. was the chicken good? Yes it was. Both times and I went their home fries were on the burnside and slightly not edible. Pancakes are nice and not dry. Both their decaf and regular coffee isn‚Äôt great.,3
22,Midnight Express Diner,"1715 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.2,Don Bernal,"For our brunch meal: filling dishes, spot on drinks and attentive service.

Farmer's omelette was a hit, and the hot cider and Belgian chocolate drinks were perfect for the chilly morning.",4
23,Midnight Express Diner,"1715 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.2,Nicky Pepe,"My adventure to New York has lasted 6 days and every day, I have come to this dinner. It is that good, no joke. Good food! Wonderful atmosphere! The Jewish parts of the restaurant where very wonderful. Kind employees! Although sometimes they are tired because they are open 24/7. But overall a wonderful place and am so glad that I found this place! And thank you so much to the staff it was a wonderful experience and I will 100% be coming back next time I am in New York! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüïéüïé",5
24,Midnight Express Diner,"1715 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.2,Stephen Clark,"What a fantastic diner. Super authentic with warm welcoming staff. All the things on the menu that you would hope and expect to be there. We ate waffles and pancakes with litres of maple syrup and crispy bacon- all washed down with chocolate milkshake and coffee. Definitely worth a trip!!! Walk off the calories with a leisurely walk to the Met museum or Central Park!!! Well done ME diner, you smashed it:)",5
25,Midnight Express Diner,"1715 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.2,Maria Lebron,"This is one of the best, if not THE best, diners on the upper east side. The decor is charming and the music always fun. The waiters remember you when you come often and are excellent servers. The food is always delicious and plentiful and comes to the table FAST FAST FAST. Im always shocked at how quickly they bring out your order. This is my go-to spot for brunch, lunch or a delicious late night breakfast craving. They also deliver. Highly recommend. Would give it 6 stars if I could.",5
26,Il Cantuccio Pizzeria Restaurant,"1638 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.5,Izabelle Monique,"This place is spotless. Came in for a canolli  that I was craving and I ended up not resisting and grabbing a slice of pizza too . Great variety of pizzas, friendly staff and cute decor. I will definitely come back . The vodka sauce pizza is DELICIOUS!!!",5
27,Il Cantuccio Pizzeria Restaurant,"1638 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.5,Jacky Cheng,"Stopped by this pizza shop for a quick lunch. Got a slice of their bacon, chicken, ranch square slice. Specialty sliced goes for $5.50. They also give you a complementary garlic knot with your slice, which was a nice surprise. Overall, a pretty good pizza joint.",4
28,Il Cantuccio Pizzeria Restaurant,"1638 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.5,Sharna,I had the Buffalo Wings. They were very spicy yet too salty.,2
29,Il Cantuccio Pizzeria Restaurant,"1638 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.5,Brooke Helmick,"Ordered take-out vegan margarita pizza. It was amazing!! I‚Äôve been craving pizza that doesn‚Äôt taste vegan and this really hit the spot. Good balance of cheese to crust as well!
I will definitely be ordering from them again!",5
30,Il Cantuccio Pizzeria Restaurant,"1638 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.5,Robin,"As far as pizza parlors go, IL Cantuccio sits apart in it's excellent cleanliness, well lit  atmospheric esthetic and website special. As of this writing, through their website, you can order an $18 large pizza pie with a free small pizza pie! Momma mia now that's a nice offering from this upper east side gem. When it comes to pizza üçï taste and variety of offerings you cannot go wrong. This is by far my family's favorite pizza place in this highly represented food cuisine on the upper east side of Manhattan. There is plenty of space to eat in and the staff is friendly and efficient. See for yourself why I bothered to write this review. Il Cantuccio gets an A+, see for yourself how this place truly sets itself above the rest!",5
31,Lolita's Kitchen & Burger House,"1364 Lexington Ave #1, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.4,Crystal,The margaritas are good here but the tacos were not my favorite! The shell was too hard and the beef was alright.,4
32,Lolita's Kitchen & Burger House,"1364 Lexington Ave #1, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.4,Augusto Paulino,"When the lunchtime crowd consists mostly of Spanish-speaking workers from the neighborhood, you know this place is for the value-conscious diner seeking good food. For lunch, $7 gets you 2 tacos (which would each cost $5 in most other places). The best part of the appetizer sampler is the chicken wing which is cooked in their secret sauce. It has a slightly peppery and smoky sour tang which is quite unique, and not your typical sweet barbecue sauce. This place is not fancy but the air conditioning could be improved though.",4
33,Lolita's Kitchen & Burger House,"1364 Lexington Ave #1, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.4,Katherine Ciaravalli,"We sat outside and had such friendly service. We ordered the fried shrimp, elote, burrito and enchiladas. Everything was hot and delicious!! Classic Mexican options at a fair price (for the UES)",5
34,Lolita's Kitchen & Burger House,"1364 Lexington Ave #1, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.4,Lion & Poodles adventures,"The food was very delicious and authentic. The restaurant is nicely decorated and romantic. However, the portions are quite small for the price. We were also a little upset that they didn‚Äôt have Horchatas considering this is a Mexican restaurant. They didn‚Äôt carry any diet sodas either, at least when we ate there, so we ended up drinking water. Nonetheless, we enjoyed our dinner here.",4
35,Lolita's Kitchen & Burger House,"1364 Lexington Ave #1, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.4,Rehman Anwar,We came here for lunch. Great value for money. We loved the food and the ambiance of the place. Tacos and grilled chicken were of great quality.,4
36,DIG,"1297 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.4,Betty Lin,"I know this is a Dig and as usual, their food is good, but I'd like to mention that their portions were good. Sometimes you go to a fast-slow-health-food chain and you're not sure what to expect (portion size, price, quality). This was a standard quality, all around great lunch. I arrived in the late afternoon and there was no line and the food was still fresh. If you love mac n cheese, their version never disappoints. Came hungry and left full.",5
37,DIG,"1297 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.4,Sofia Alecseeva,"What a Delicious food they serve in here and for a good price! It's a nice little restaurant with friendly and attentive staff. The dish size is not too big and not too small, it has enough food for you to be full and happy :) what I like about this restaurant is that they serve food in a takeaway plates, so if you're in a rush or need to go somewhere, you can put it inside one of the bags they have, and leave. Overall, I would rate it as a 10/10 experience and would definitely recommend it to tourists like me.",5
38,DIG,"1297 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.4,Spyridoula M,"One of the best salad bars I have visited! Very friendly staff and good food. Not too pricey and good lunch portions!
Wish the dining area was a little more organized/clean! Would definitely come again!",4
39,DIG,"1297 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.4,Patricia Camova,"The food was nice, however, the staff was very rude and was basically shouting at me what do I want to eat while giving me looks when I didnt understand and double asked for something. Couldnt even ask for some extras and so on they inmediately packed everything just to be done with me",3
40,DIG,"1297 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.4,Massbaum,"Bottom line, this place has great food.. We were spending the afternoon exploring the Met just a few blocks away and decided to take a walk and find a ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô lunch (not always easy in NYC).. I found this place using Google Maps and we were definitely not disappointed.. They have a buffet/assembly line system so the service is fast.. We had our orders super quick and found a table within minutes.. The food was fresh and absolutely delicious.. Just what we were craving.. Service was decent, but your only interaction with the staff is when they put your order together.. Prices are very fair, considering the location and the quality of the food.. All in all this place is great and totally worth a visit if you‚Äôre in the area..",4
41,LaRustica Pizza,"1426 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4,Alex Saralegui,"I recently moved to NYC on the same block as La Rustica. I‚Äôd ordered from them before on Slice and thought it was great pizza. I walked in tonight and ordered a pizza - they charged me $30 (vs. $18 advertised on Slice). When I confronted them, they became very awkward and refunded me $4 (still not what they advertised?) - it felt very dishonest that they‚Äôd tried to charge me so much more in case I didn‚Äôt notice. Loved the pizza but will not be my go-to - make sure you are careful to check what they charge you.",2
42,LaRustica Pizza,"1426 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4,Lindsay Feinstein,"I placed an order with Uber eats for a pasta, salad, and pizza. When I received the order the pizza was not there so I reported it to Uber eats and they gave me a credit for the entire meal. The Uber driver came back to my place to tell me that he never picked up the pizza from the restaurant so I proceeded to call the restaurant and explain to them why they weren't getting paid for the entire order and the person at the restaurant literally hung up on me. How rude. Don't ever order from here because the people are extremely rude!",1
43,LaRustica Pizza,"1426 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4,David,"Low quality ingredients and not very good.

It‚Äôs open late which might be the only thing to their benefit but‚Ä¶ the pizza is just not very good. I got a cheese slice and something just tasted weird and off about it - maybe the oil they used. There‚Äôs a number of dollar slices in the city that taste better than this. And I got penne ala vodka which was also just not very good. All the food was just disappointing and subpar and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend. There‚Äôs just no reason to go here when there‚Äôs so many better options in the city. This place just kind of sucks.",1
44,LaRustica Pizza,"1426 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4,Faisal Alghassab,"Definitely my favorite pizza joint in the UES. The crust is immaculate! It is crispy with a ton of cornmeal on the bottom, something which I love. Pizzas are average in terms of price with a cheese slice at 3$. Definitely recommend if you want good pizza on the go",5
45,LaRustica Pizza,"1426 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4,Fnky Chld,"OMG their pizza hits the spot.  Love the Margherita.  Just tastes like high quality ingredients.  I never tasted cheese and sweet tomatoes of that high quality from a regular mom and pop pizza spot.  Plus the portion of cheese has some bite to it which I love, as most Margheritas just have a thin layer of cheese.  Nice crunchy crust too despite the saucy toppings.  Really satisfying.",5

47,Subway,"1256 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10028, USA",3.8,sarah rambert,"I didn‚Äôt get my receipt but I was there at 3:20pm. I ordered a number 16 and another 6in. The lady working the line she had red orange hair under her hat, gold nose ring, short about 5‚Äô3 or 5‚Äô4. She was yelling at her coworkers in a degrading, unprofessional way. You could tell the older lady was new to the job and she yelled at her, spoke down on her as if she was not even a human being. As a customer, along with other customers on the line, it made me feel awful to even spend my time or money there. It was so sad and uncomfortable. Your team should know how to talk to others in a calm and patience way, especially when they are new to the job. No one should be treated in such a manner. I hope you all hold this employee accountable. Everyone that works for your company should be treated fairly.",1

They have a lot of dishes not normally seen on a Chinese menu.  I loved the pork with dried Tofu.  The Taiwanese popcorn chicken was yummy.  The hot and sour soup was a bit runny but still good.  Service here is fast and efficient.,4
52,Wok 88,"1570 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.3,Bradley C,"The orange beef I got was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. However, the orange flavor can be stronger. Overall, it was a good Chinese restaurant and I will come back in the future.",4

This time I got the Steak Frites for the first time and it did not disappoint! Comes out on a steaming skillet similar to fajita style so bonus points for presentation! I also got the jerk chicken dry rub wings and they were such a unique flavor that I‚Äôll definitely be getting again!

Stopped in here with some friends and family on the first snow you guys had in record-breaking time in January. Steve, Kenny, and Casey and the owner took fantastic care of us. We had a great time. Enjoyed the game and we're welcomed by deep snow on our way out. They allowed us to close the bar with them enjoying the ambiance of a busy bar now empty towards closing except for the strong team of coworkers present. The food was good, the team was great, and the environment was excellent. 10 out of 10 would recommend. The next time I'm back in town I'll see you back on the East End. Sorry it took so long for the review. See you next time.",5
58,East End Bar & Grill,"1672 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.5,Riley Pimpinelli,We really love this place. Awesome setup for watching sports and really yummy bar food. I will say that this would be a 4 star review if it weren‚Äôt for Marissa and Vinny. Marissa is seriously the best server of all time. Vinny (bartender) is really nice about accommodating different sports games on different parts of the bar and making everyone happy. We only come on the days when they‚Äôre working.,5

60,East End Bar & Grill,"1672 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.5,Phaino Aletha,"Wonderful bar that is well organized with great service to watch the football game. They are a ‚öúÔ∏èSaints‚öúÔ∏è bar or Saints playing. It has at least fifteen screens and fans for different games in each section. Make a reservation as there is no open seating. It has a great ambiance and the place was full of energy but no craziness or chaos. The food is excellent!

I appreciated greatly being able to watch the game with a friend and have fun, be comfortable and not be heckled or have any weirdness. I definitely recommend!

Went there again and this NOLA lady has found her place! I am bringing everyone here. Everyone is amazing.‚öúÔ∏è",5
61,Bocado,"1293 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.3,Carly Pisarri,"Went on a Sunday for early brunch. The food was phenomenal. Burger was messy and great - the raw onions could have been excluded. My cousin said the waffle was maybe the best she has ever had. A good outside crunch w a very soft interior.

The latte was very frothy and full of flavor. The mimosa w fresh squeezed orange juice was superior. I would DEF come back.",5
62,Bocado,"1293 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.3,KR,"I recently visited a bustling brunch spot, and while the ambiance was lively, but it gets really busy so I would suggest making reservations early on.
Service: The service at this establishment was prompt for the most part. Our coffees and water were refilled without having to ask, which was appreciated. However, I found it off-putting when the waiter asked if we wanted the check while we were still enjoying our food. It felt a bit rushed and could have been handled more tactfully.
Food: The food had its ups and downs. The French toast, served with maple syrup on the side, was satisfying and met expectations. However, the avocado toast with poached eggs fell short. It lacked seasoning, leaving it bland and unremarkable. Additionally, the side salad accompanying the dish was uninspired, lacking flavor and freshness.
Overall, while the ambiance and some aspects of the service were enjoyable, the inconsistency in the food quality detracted from the overall experience.",3

If you are considering a side order of breakfast sausages, I would recommend sharing. We definitely thought we were only getting a couple links per side order. A beverage was also included in the price of our brunch entree, so the value is definitely there!",4

I ordered 3 tacos, chicken, pork and beef. And I can tell you that the rating is not lying, the food is absolutely amazing!

I‚Äôm a big fan of Los Tacos No.1 but their tacos are so expensive now(carne asada is $5.65). This food truck has the exact same flavor and quality and each taco is $4!!!

I‚Äôd come here everyday if I live in the neighborhood.",5

But all in all it was a slight .... very slight step up from your typical corner chinese hole in the wall.

I got a large sesame chicken. Menu said chicken pieces deep fried to perfection.

1st I paid 22.00 it was a small size plate

2nd it was all bread like all other cheap Chinese. Not one piece had a chunk of chicken.

The only good thing it was very crispy and sauce was good. But never again",2

- great pepperoni. Small & flavorful.
- Free water.
- open seating space layout.
- Sauce is bland.
- Cheese is doing its job. But has No flavor
- spices are in packets. Not as fresh.
- Big thin crust is great.

Not my favorite NYC pizza but the pepperoni is on point.",5
89,Marinara Pizza,"1376 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.3,Dominique,"I stopped by here sometime in 2020 and remember being underwhelmed by the MVP (marinara, vodka, pesto and) slice. I gave it another chance and it was great. I also ordered their vodka slice, which was very good as well. Seeing that their vodka sauce was delicious, I also ordered chicken parm in vodka sauce. It was so cheesy as it should be. I got a side of their burnt broccoli, because I love roasted broccoli. This one is delicious with big chunks crispy, toasted garlic. I also got their chicken Caesar salad slice, because if I'm getting a salad it has to be on pizza. Everything was tasty and the service was quick and efficient. Overall, I would definitely go there if you're on the Upper East Side.

93,Original Roma Pizza,"1562 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.4,Krishna Gaurav,Some of the best pizza in Upper Manhattan esp if you like yours crunchy and appreciate a thick sauce. The square pepperoni is worth every visit and the slightly premium prize.,5

We‚Äôve also celebrated big moments there as well. The atmosphere is perfect for a romantic dinner. The waitstaff and managers are over accommodating in the best way. Finally, THE FOOD. Is. DIVINE. Their flatbread is easily the best appetizer I‚Äôve ever had and I didn‚Äôt even know what figs were, haha. Their pappardelle bolognese is honestly the signature home run dish. You won‚Äôt find better anywhere. If you‚Äôre not a meat lover go with any of their other homemade recipe pasta and you won‚Äôt be disappointed. IF you‚Äôre lucky enough to get their special apple dessert with cinnamon ice cream, oooooo good lord you better get it! Terrific food at a terrific restaurant in a terrific neighborhood. Go!",5
97,Sfoglia,"1402 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.4,Zachary Dennett,"Sfoglia fell one Artic Char, one lettuce salad, and some minutes of slow service away from 5 stars.

But, starting with the positives. The space features rustic wooden tables and lovely decor. We loved the ravioli doppio. The dish burst with fun and unexpected flavors. The veal Milanese hit expectations but did not exceed. And, we all enjoyed the Caesar salad, but then again, it‚Äôs hard to mess up a Caesar salad.

One in our party order and Arctic char. Bad move. The fish came cooked closer to sushi levels than the medium rare she ordered. And, she was disappointed with the taste.

I‚Äôd also suggest avoiding the little gem lettuce. I didn‚Äôt like it at all, though some else in the group did.",4

99,Sfoglia,"1402 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.4,Neivin Mathew,"The food here is decent enough, but the prices do not match the food. Service is amazing though.

I ordered the burrata, duck fat potatoes, papardelle bolognese and the eggplant/sausage pasta. The flavors are good but some of the food was cold.

The place has a rustic farmhouse aesthetic and is pretty cozy inside. Be warned that if you're over 6ft tall you cannot sit comfortably inside because the tables are so low to the ground.",3

Location: It is located at UES, lexington Ave. We made reservations cause it is always packed here! There is outdoor and indoor seating! The indoor is nice, quite dark. The outdoor is nice, feels like you are in Italy. Street parking available at the side

Service: OMG our server is nice. I noticed that she is in the elderly side, and I love that, it means that the restaurant does not discriminate! Thank you for that.

Food: Food here is hit or missed! BURRATA: this was my first Burrata and it was delicious!! Omg! There are green peas on it and the burrata is so silky. SFOGLIA CAESAR: the best caesar salad I had in my life! It was perfect! Not too much or too less of the dressing and I love the anchovies on it! CURED ITALIAN MEATS: this is good as well, different types of meat with a good bread sticks! PAPPARDELE: good, taste like deconstructed lasagna! FETTUCCINI: best fettuccine that I ate, the cream and chunks of ham is good, the pasta was al dente! SAFFRON RISOTTO: the risotto was cooked well, didn‚Äôt got that much of the crab tho. SFOGLIA‚ÄôS CHICKEN AL MATTONE: they said this was very popular but it was okay for me, it is like fried chicken with lemon on it. It was okay. BONE IN VEAL CHOP: another one that was okay. Expensive but it was just fried with a side of salad, nothing special for me. STRAWBERRY RHUBARB TORTA: omg this was good! The crust was so good and the filling was not that sweet which I like! The ice cream binds it together, the thing is you have to preorder this so order it on the beginning!

Price rating: 9/10, quite expensive to be honest but if you buy what I recommend you will be fine.

Will probably come back here for the Caesar salad, buratta, fettuccini and the strawberry rhubarb torta! 2 orders each!! Lol",4

Both the restaurant itself and the food presentation were very aesthetic, with a lot of thought put into both. The service is quick and friendly, and the prices are good too‚Äî especially compared to other Thai spots in the area.

Food I tried:
- Garlic sauce saut√© with mock duck (5/5): This was my favorite dish from here. The mock duck was super tasty, with a delicious meat-like texture and strong garlicky soy sauce flavor. You can really taste the garlic in the sauce, and it was really good.

- Bamee yok nah petd (3.8/5): I didn‚Äôt love this one as the noodles made up the majority of the dish yet they were kind of bland and overpowering. The duck was crispy and flavorful though. Because there wasn‚Äôt much else in this dish besides the noodles and duck, it was kind of a monotonous dish overall.

- Pad woon sen with mock duck (4.3/5): This was pretty good‚Äî again the mock duck was amazing and the glass noodles were flavorful and well-saut√©ed.

I started the meal off with some minestrone soup. It was very good, although the portion size was pretty small. I liked the fine cut of the vegetables. Flavorful and rich broth.

Then came the chicken Parmesan! It was served on a bed of spaghetti. I had a requested the spicy marinara sauce, that‚Äôs just the way I like it. I‚Äôm glad I requested this change this sauce because it was very good. The pasta was nice as well. However, I didn‚Äôt love the chicken Parm. The breading was soggy. That was a disappointment for me. Also, they brought over crushed red pepper but didn‚Äôt offer Parmesan cheese for the entree (although Parmesan cheese was offered for the soup, which I turned down).

The vibe inside was nice. Dimly lit with a nostalgic feel. The checks were handwritten, which is a nice touch. The water was constantly refilled. They had availability on a busy night, probably 3/4 full. Extensive wine list, triple the food list. I asked for a glass of rose which cost me $22, which felt expensive, especially for the pour that I was given.",4

I went with my mother and girlfriend for New Years Eve dinner and had really bad quality food. I ordered the sea food pasta special and the clams and salmon were not fresh. Moreover, I asked for the alioli sauce option which had a watery taste. I had two bites of it and that was it.

My mother and girlfriend had very negative choice as well. My girlfriend ordered a pasta carbonara that had a burnt taste and same thing, was not able to finish it. My mother ordered a salad that was in the specials menu and ate it but said that it was super plain as well.

The bread was dry and hard. Had to put a lot of butter to be able to eat it.

The worst part about the whole experience was the poor attitude of the waiter who said that we were wrong when we communicated to them that the food had a very bad quality. My mother is from Italy and has been eating highest quality pasta all her life so I have.

Never coming back to this restaurant again.",1

Right after the other waiter came to pick up our plates, the waitress immediately came to us to pay. When we clicked on custom tip, she rudely yelled ‚Äúyou can only tip 25, 20, or 18%‚Äù and proceeded to go back to this screen for us. We only wanted to tip 15% because she was being very rude‚Ä¶ She then snatched the machine and berated us to make a point that we did not tip her a lot. I also want to make a point that she did not seat or serve us at any point the entire time we were there. Loved the food and the kitchen for making great food but will never come back to this location because of this horrible experience.

When I notified the waiter and pointed it out, he started telling me how outrageous it was to suggest it wasn‚Äôt mine. It was NOT mine, as I have a completely different hair length/texture than the one I found. He kept talking on and on about how the ventilation may have blown one of our hairs onto the pasta but it simply just wasn‚Äôt possible. He was rude through the experience, never once acknowledged that it may be their fault. This restaurant is filled with cheesy art as well- it makes you feel like you‚Äôre at a bad bed and breakfast.

The wine list does veer on the pricey side, but I‚Äôve also been able to find a few bottles at a relatively good value to make the night work well.

This Popeyes chicken at 1572 3rd Ave. in New York City is the only one I have ever eaten in. It is dirty! You have to leave your tray and garbage on the tables as they don‚Äôt ever seem to empty the waist baskets. They do not sweep on a regular basis. They do not wipe down the tables.
The staff is pleasant, but if you ask for a manager, they nearly faint! Heaven help you if you‚Äôd like to speak to an owner! There is no way to get in touch with anyone in authority.
I was given a $75 gift certificate as a Christmas present. I tried to use it today neither the ladies on the register nor the manager had any idea how I could do that. The manager said it‚Äôs online only! That is not true! I was not able to use my gift certificate. There was no one with whom I could speak.
Today was dine in. Mostly I take out as it is very dirty and they seem to cater to only one class of people with no interest in the rest of us. They don‚Äôt have their own delivery people. You have to call a delivery company and then you have no idea who it is that would be coming to your apartment.
If they open the Popeyes east of third Avenue and below 86th St., they would have a whole different group of people and they would have to keep it clean.",2

Almost like the light and life my old friend Cornelius and I felt upon or entrance into Pain Quotidian. Yet, this sorry takes a turn, for it was not just love and light that we felt, but a presence, though small, of disappointment. After paying the expenses of a smooth and enticing looking chocolate mousse cake and a decorated but flattened almond croissant, my old friend Cornelius was overwhelmed with a cloying sweet taste. It happened to be that the mousse did not, in fact, hit the spot. Though he did enjoy the pleasant surprise of a coconut yogurt chia pudding, which did hit spot, though the overripe and soppy banana resting at bottom indeed, did not. He was again, disappointed.   With $16 spent and a heavy heart, he again made the journey to the counter, to purchase ‚Äútea,‚Äù which was, in reality, leaves floating in murky deep green water. Though sipping at this sea through an old paper cup provided some comfort to Cornelius‚Äô startled stomach, it did not reach the full satisfaction of true, life-altering TEA. It was not TEA, it was just T. It is not worthy of any more letters or space on this review. I shall exit the tea description now. And finally, my croissant. Let‚Äôs talk about my croissant. As if it could no longer stand exist me, the crossing flopped, unable to hold itself up, as it made a journey from the cashier‚Äôs hand into an old paper bag. It slid out of the bag into my hand in a similar manner, unable to contain any joy, any life force. As I placed it upon my tastebuds, they revolted, screaming at a sensation of grainy tastelessness. I was equally devastated as Cornelius. Our spirits lifted a bit as we noticed the mildly nice atmosphere, a places decked in old woods and tiled floors. Though atrocious, the pastries added a nice look to the place, their delicate bready layers lightly glazed under a warmly lit glass case. Now, as I gaze over at the crossaint‚Äôs confetti and lines of unfinished mousse upon a golden paper plate, I enter a place of profound confusion and deep loss. Dear friends, my heart yearns to search for the caf√© that nourishes every twist and turn of my intensities, allow my neuron synapses to fuse and fire, bring my psyche to the forefront, and allow me to truly, finally, feel at rest. Please, good friends, people of this fragmented online community, join me, as i continue to embark on a journey of seeking for this cafe.

It‚Äôs also pictured with lettuce, but not included in the description so I wasn‚Äôt necessarily expecting lettuce but still odd it‚Äôs in the picture. Regardless, sandwich came with no pickles which honestly was why I ordered the ham sandwich over the prosciutto sandwich, and mustard was localized in one small portion of the bread, wasn‚Äôt even spread out. Really disappointing sandwich for $7.50 and just not worth it. The soft bread was the only good part of the sandwich. Also ordered a side of chicken soup.

The bad:
Bathroom was smelly and there was a weird smell leaking to the table that was close.
If you like Guinness don't order it here. It is very disappointing,  fast, no well gasified, the temperature was not correct so a BIG no.

I'm pretty picky about Hollandaise sauce (and eggs, honestly)  considering we raise chickens and I make eggs Benedict all the time with our fresh eggs, and this was good.  I would have liked a bit more lemon, and maybe a lunch more salt in the sauce, but the egg was poached perfectly and the sauce was smooth. I liked the grilled Italian sausage side as well.

Avoid the fish roe dip, taramosalata, because it taste like fish roe with cream cheese which is a sad interpretation of what it really is.",3

I typically opt for the kefta or salmon, but I have sampled just about all of them. The proteins are expertly prepared, succulent and perfectly complementary of the sides. The fries are truly a best kept secret. While Mediterranean cuisine is not ordinarily known for french fries, Yasouvlaki has what I would consider award-winning fries. Delightfully seasoned with perfect levels of crispness. The tabbouleh rounds the meal off with a touch of freshness and acid. On a nice day, the outdoor seating is a treat, offering world class people watching. A lovely establishment that perhaps flies slightly under the radar",5

Once sat our server Jack told us the specials and let us know his favs on the menu‚Ä¶ He was  super knowledgeable and  super friendly!! We ordered the mixed grill,  bottle of wine and baklava  and everything seriously exceeded expectations!! We mentioned to Jack we were considering a salad and he subbed one of the items on our mixed grill for a Greek salad which was awesome!   Never once did we have to ask for more water or more of anything..  Definitely will be bringing friends and family here!!",5

I‚Äôve been on this earth for 40 years and I swear on my fam that this is the best restaurant I‚Äôve ever been to. Period. Everything was made with love. 10/10 for everything: atmosphere, service, quality, portion size, price. My only issue was they didn‚Äôt have shirts for sale",5
186,Yasouvlaki,"1568 3rd Ave, New York, NY 10128, USA",4.6,Augusto Paulino,"The lunch special options include a sandwich ($19 plus tax) or a skewer ($14). I chose the falafel on a pita, which came with soup and a drink. The lemon chicken soup was very good, light but with a distinct lemon flavor and chunks of chicken. The fries were well seasoned but a bit odd to see them in the actual sandwich rather than on the side. The red onions and tomatoes were a good accompaniment to the falafel. Overall it was a hearty and satisfying lunch.",4
