The tacos were very well seasoned and tasty the but my favorite was the chips in guacamole and the green sauce I really don't know the name for it but we put it on our tacos we even put it on our nachos so it was pretty good I do recommend this place for a quick bite if you really don't have any thoughts on where to eat This would be a good spot to grab a couple of tacos😁\""

There was no line at around 6:30 which was great, though they were clearly doing business.  Tables inside were about half taken.  It was very warm inside so we opted for the nice \"al fresco\" option they offer outside.  Pizza was reheated quickly, cut into pieces and promptly served to our table.  That said, although the crust was perfectly cooked - most of the toppings were disappointing.   Not \"bad\" pizza- but definitely not the finest NY has to offer.  Would I come back?  Sure.

       "\"A lovely, hole-in-the-wall little cafe tucked in the corner of a boba shop with tasty food, including an impressively vast selection of vegan and vegetarian options. There's no seating inside the shop, but the Eleanor Roosevelt Memorial Park is just a few blocks away if you're alright with enjoying your food outside! The food was tasty, but a bit heavy and oversaturated with oil for my taste -- I opted for the egg white omelette, which didn't include any cheese (yay for me and my lactose intolerant friends), but did have a boat load of fresh veggies! It was incredibly tasty, and honestly way bigger than I was expecting, but did make me feel pretty greasy afterwards. The potatoes were even more saturated in oil and a bit oversalted, but still delicious. The meal also came with toast, which was just white bread toasted in what smelled like butter, so I didn't end up partaking, but the friend that I had gone to brunch with said that it was oddly chewy (potentially because it had to be wrapped in tin foil immediately after toasting).\\n\\nShe opted for one of their signature avocado toasts, which she adored -- it looks small, but it was incredibly filling, especially since they load on what seems like half or all of an avocado onto a single, frail piece of multigrain toast. The bread definitely couldn't hold up the heft of the avocado and salmon for long, so she ended up just eating her toast with a knife and fork, but it was still delicious nonetheless.\\n\\nThe cashier was really sweet and helpful, but it did take an incredibly long time for us to get our food; even though we were the only ones in the restaurant, we ended up waiting upwards of 25 minutes to get our to-go orders. Thankfully we weren't in too much of a rush, but I would definitely recommend opting for another spot if you're looking for a quick option.\\n\\nEven so, Cafe Bee has a delightfully cute concept with great options for folks following a plant-based diet, and is definitely still on the top of my NYC breakfast recommendations!\""

    "Again, I do not see a good improvement in the clustering performance: general distribution of clustering per each user star rating bucket do not significantly differ from that of the K-means methods. There are still instances where good and bad reviews are clustered in the same cluster as you can see above. And, again, I see cases where good reviews had mediocre user star rating. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "### Final Observations\n",
    "The sentiment analysis models (i.e., VADER and Roberta) did a good job providing general sentiment of a collection of reviews. In fact, it was able to decently distinguish overall sentiment per star rating buckets on an aggregated level. However, for a specific/individual review, the model often provided incorrect sentiment scores, especially in a situation where the text reviews were sarcastic or had nuanced criticisms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the reclassification model often mis-categorized individual reviews in a wrong bucket, on the bright side, we were able to see some occasions where star rating reclassification model correctly reclassified star rating based on text reviews as some users were overly harsh or loose on their star ratings. Hence, we do see an opportunity and benefit of deploying such model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations:\n",
    "From the project, following are my recommendations to the PM:\n",
    "1. Post example reviews per different star rating buckets to create a general criteria/guideline for what each star rating means (to prevent very harsh or loose star ratings)\n",
    "2. Beta-test ML+NLP/LLM-based restaurant star rating system (i.e., based on sentiment analysis model) in addition to the traditional star rating system and get user's feedback\n",
    "3. Beta-test star rating assistant feature: when there appears to be a big mismatch in text review's sentiment score and user's star rating, assistant feature can provide a suggested star rating, which user can override if user would like to"
